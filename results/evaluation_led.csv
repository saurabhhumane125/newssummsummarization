Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Wednesday said that the Chinese People's Liberation Army's (PLA) violent conduct completely violates all norms and agreements between India and China.

""The PLA's violent conduct completely violates all norms and agreements between India and China. India has taken strong measures to safeguard its borders. We are committed to resolving the issue peacefully,"" Singh said in a statement.

Singh's statement comes after a violent clash between Indian and Chinese troops in Galwan Valley, Ladakh, on June 15, 2020, in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed. The PLA also suffered casualties, but the exact number is unknown.

The clash was the deadliest between Indian and Chinese troops since 1975. It has led to a significant increase in tensions between the two countries.

Singh said that India has taken strong measures to safeguard its borders. He said that the Indian Army is fully prepared to deal with any challenge from the PLA.

""Our armed forces are fully prepared to deal with any challenge. We are committed to resolving the issue peacefully. However, we will not compromise on our national security,"" Singh said.

The Indian government has said that it is committed to resolving the issue with China through dialogue and diplomacy. However, it has also said that it will not be intimidated by the PLA's aggressive behavior.

The clash in Galwan Valley has raised concerns about the possibility of a war between India and China. However, both countries have said that they do not want war.

The Guwahati Municipal Corporation (GMC) has launched a ""construction and demolition waste"" pick-up service to prevent the debris from clogging drains and waterways in the city. Sharing insights into the initiative, GMC Assistant Commissioner Suhel Yasir explained that the corporation is taking proactive measures to clear the dust and debris resulting from demolition activities.He further noted that while the GMC currently lacks a dedicated processing facility for such waste, they are actively considering the establishment of a C&D facility which is mandated under the Swachh Bharat Mission to make the city waste-free. The GMC has also introduced a helpline number which allows the public to request waste removal services from the corporation following demolition projects. The specific fee for this service is yet to be determined and will be fixed at a later date.

Delhi's air quality was recorded in the 'poor' category for the fourth consecutive day on Thursday and any improvement is unlikely soon, according to monitoring agencies.

The city's 24-hour average Air Quality Index (AQI) stood at 256 at 4 pm, worsening from 243 on Wednesday and 220 on Tuesday.

The average AQI was 235 in neighbouring Ghaziabad, 254 in Faridabad, 230 in Gurugram, 191 in Noida and 260 in Greater Noida.

According to the Centre's Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi, the city's air quality is likely to oscillate between the 'poor' and 'very poor' categories over the next three to four days.

An AQI between zero and 50 is considered 'good', 51 and 100 'satisfactory', 101 and 200 'moderate', 201 and 300 'poor', 301 and 400 'very poor', and 401 and 500 'severe'.

The government also launched a campaign to curb vehicular pollution on Thursday, a year after Lieutenant Governor V K Saxena put it on hold, questioning its effectiveness.

A 2019 study conducted by the Central Road Research Institute showed that keeping engines running at traffic signals can increase pollution levels by more than 9 per cent.

A range of emission inventory and source apportionment studies carried out for Delhi in the past few years suggested that on-road vehicular exhaust emissions account for 9 per cent to 38 per cent of PM2.5 emissions in the capital.

Delhi's air quality had turned 'very poor' on Sunday for the first time since May, mainly due to a drop in temperature and wind speed, which allowed pollutants to accumulate.

Unfavourable meteorological conditions and a cocktail of emissions from firecrackers and paddy straw burning, in addition to local sources of pollution, push Delhi-NCR's air quality to hazardous levels around Diwali every year.

According to an analysis conducted by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee, the capital experiences peak pollution from November 1 to November 15, when stubble burning incidents in Punjab and Haryana peak.

Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai said the government has identified eight more pollution hotspots in addition to the existing 13 in the national capital, and special teams will be deployed there to check pollution sources.

Rai said the government has also decided to use suppressant powder to prevent dust pollution in the city.

Dust suppressants could include chemical agents like calcium chloride, magnesium chloride, lignosulfonates and various polymers. These chemicals work by attracting and binding fine dust particles together, making them too heavy to become airborne.

The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM), a statutory body responsible for proactively implementing the pollution control plan known as the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), had on Saturday directed authorities in the NCR to increase parking fees to discourage private transport and enhance the services of CNG or electric buses and metro trains amid a likely increase in pollution levels.

This action is part of Stage II of GRAP which is implemented when Delhi's AQI is predicted to turn 'very poor'.

GRAP categorises actions into four stages: Stage I 'poor' (AQI 201-300); Stage II 'very poor' (AQI 301-400); Stage III 'severe' (AQI 401-450); and Stage IV 'severe plus' (AQI >450).

The Delhi government had last month launched a 15-point action plan to mitigate air pollution in the capital during the winter season, with a strong emphasis on addressing dust pollution, vehicular emissions and open burning of garbage.

Thousands of people watched the famous Ravan Dahan event at Central Sports Grounds in Banaras Locomotive Works (BLW) on Tuesday evening as this year the Dussehra festival was celebrated with great pomp and its traditional fervour. In the recent decades, the event has become very popular as a huge number of people turned out there. When the effigies of ‘Demon King’ Ravana, his brother Kumbhakaran and son Meghnad which were 75, 70 and 65 feet high respectively were burnt, the mood of the people turned electrified and the slogans of ‘Jai Siya Ram’ echoed the atmosphere. The grounds as well as roads in its surrounding areas were packed with thousands of people. A large number of firecrackers were set in all the three effigies.

The event marked the triumph of good over evil and prior to that, the artistes performed Ramlila. The audience was mesmerised by the dialogue of Angad and Ravana and wars between Lord Ram and Ravana as well as Lakshman and Meghnath. After defeating Ravana by Lord Ram, the event of burning of effigies began. Prior to effigy burning, the firecrackers were lit, changing the mood of the people. Earlier, the Principal Chief Electrical Engineer (PCEE) SK Srivastava performed the aarti of Lord Ram and Mata Sita. Then the artistes performed Lila of Ram Van Gaman to Ravana Vadh based on Ramcharitmanas. The Lila performed by the students of BLW Inter College for two-and-a-half hours was highly appreciated.

There was a ban on carrying bags, tiffins, water bottles and any kind of inflammable material in the fair premises. Even after 12 noon, all types of vehicles including two wheelers were stopped from entering the Mela areas. General Manager Basudev Panda constantly instructed the officials to make the Vijayadashami fair well organised. District administration, Uttar Pradesh Police, Railway Protection Force, St John’s Ambulance Brigade, Civil Defence, District Scouts and Guides and members of Vijayadashami Committee played an important role in conducting the fair smoothly and peacefully. To deal with any untoward incident, the medical team of BLW Central Hospital was present there, setting up its first aid posts there.

   The Ravana Dahan event of BLW is unique in itself as it is an example of Ganga-Yamuni (harmonious) culture. The effigies of Ravana, Kumbhakaran and Meghnad are made by Shamshad Khan and his family, who have been residents of Kashi for three generations and Angad was portrayed by Sohrab Hussain in this unique Ramlila.

A day after US President Joe Biden, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak landed in war-torn Israel on Thursday. Rishi Sunak said that Britain would stand by Israel in ""its darkest hour"". Meanwhile, the Australian government today accused Israel of collectively punishing Palestinians in its war on Hamas.

On Wednesday, hours after a blast at a hospital in Gaza killed hundreds, Israel said that it would allow Egypt to deliver limited humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip. Assessing the explosion, the White House said the Gaza hospital explosion appeared to be the result of an errant rocket fired by a terrorist group in Gaza.

There were conflicting claims about who was behind the explosion on Tuesday night, but protests flared quickly in the region as many Arab leaders said Israel was responsible. Hamas officials in Gaza quickly blamed an Israeli airstrike, saying hundreds were killed. Israel denied it was involved and released a flurry of video, audio and other information that it said showed the blast was instead due to a rocket misfire by Islamic Jihad, another terrorist group operating in Gaza. Islamic Jihad dismissed that claim.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR | TOP DEVELOPMENTS
British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak met his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday. Rishi Sunak assured that Britain would stand by Israel in ""its darkest hour"".


""I know that you are taking every precaution to avoid harming civilians in direct contrast to the terrorists of Hamas which seeks to put civilians in harm's way,"" Rishi Sunak said alongside Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem. ""I welcome your decision yesterday that you took to ensure that routes into Gaza will be opened for humanitarian aid to enter ... I'm proud to stand here with you. In Israel's darkest hour as your friend. We will stand with you in solidarity. We will stand with your people and we also want you to win.""

Benjamin Netanyahu told Rishi Sunak that the October 7 attack by Hamas terrorists was aimed to prevent the expansion of its peaceful relations in the Middle East. ""We were on the cusp of expanding that peace, and destroying that move was one of the reasons why this action was taken,"" he said.

""This is our darkest hour,"" Netanyahu added. ""That means that this is a long war, and we'll need your continuous support.""

The Australian government has accused Israel of collectively punishing Palestinians in its war on Hamas.

""I feel very strongly that Palestinians are being collectively punished here for Hamas’ barbarism. I really do feel there is an obligation on governments, particularly the Israeli government, to follow the rules of international law and to observe in particular that innocents should be protected,"" the Associated Press quoted Australian government minister Ed Husic as saying.

In his first comments on the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, Chinese President Xi Jinping said his country wants the war to be stopped as soon as possible.

""China wants the Israel-Hamas war to be stopped as soon as possible. Beijing was willing to work with Arab governments for a lasting solution to the conflict. A ceasefire was ""imperative"" as soon as possible to prevent the conflict from expanding, or spiralling out of control.""

President Joe Biden, who swept into wartime Israel for a seven-and-a-half-hour visit on Wednesday, wrapped up his stay in Tel Aviv.

Likening the October 7 Hamas assault to the attacks against the United States on September 11, 2001, that killed nearly 3,000 people, Biden said, ""I understand. Many Americans understand. You can't look at what has happened here and not scream out for justice. But I caution this: While you feel that rage, don't be consumed by it. After 9/11, we were enraged in the United States. And while we sought justice and got justice, we also made mistakes.""

As the United States concluded Israel was not responsible for the Gaza hospital bombing, Biden also said, ""I'm not suggesting Hamas deliberately bombed the Gaza hospital.""

The digital age amplifies voices, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent posts on X (formerly Twitter) condemning the Hamas attacks on Israel have certainly not gone unnoticed. Whilst there has been uproar and viral retweets across the Arab world, the absence of India's reaffirmation on the Israel-Palestine two-state solution at the leadership level is stark.

Hasan Alhasan, a Middle East expert at IISS, told India Today, ""The Indian Prime Minister, within a few hours of the Hamas attack took a very partisan, very clear stance on Twitter by tweeting that India stood in solidarity with Israel."" He went on to mention the potential fallout from this stance, pointing out that ""India has associated its own reputation now with the Israeli response.""
For instance, a tweet/X post points to a specific perspective, amplifying the sentiment felt by many in the Arab world. Abdul Khaled Abdulla, a professor of political science posted, “The Indian position was in solidarity with the Palestinian cause for a long time, and then there was a gradual shift towards recognizing Israel and deepening strategic relations with it. Today, it has become completely identified with Israel, and has even begun to align itself with it to the point of declaring support for its aggression against Gaza.”

Furthermore, the position that the Arab world sees India take could have ramifications for the massive Indian diaspora living in the Middle East or West Asia. Alhasan raised concerns about communal tensions escalating if India's domestic politics spilled into the diaspora in the Gulf. He recalled the rise in anti-Muslim sentiments in 2020 by the Indian far-right that affected NRIs (Non-Resident Indians) in the Gulf.

Israeli airstrikes pounded locations across the Gaza Strip early Thursday, including parts of the south that Israel had declared as safe zones, heightening fears among more than 2 million Palestinians trapped in the territory that nowhere was safe.

In the nearly two weeks since a devastating Hamas rampage in southern Israel, the Israeli military has relentlessly attacked Gaza in response. Even after Israel told Palestinians to evacuate the north and head to what it called “safe zones” in the south, strikes continued overnight throughout the densely populated territory.

A residential building in Khan Younis, a city in southern Gaza where hundreds of thousands of Palestinians had fought shelter, was among the places hit. Medical personnel at Nasser Hospital said they received at least 12 dead and 40 wounded.

The bombardments came after Israel agreed Wednesday to allow Egypt to deliver limited humanitarian aid to Gaza, the first crack in a punishing 11-day siege. Many among Gaza’s 2.3 million residents have cut down to one meal a day and resorted to drinking dirty water.

The announcement of a plan to bring water, food and other supplies into Gaza came as fury over a Tuesday night explosion at Gaza City’s al-Ahli Hospital spread across the Middle East. There were conflicting claims of who was behind the blast, which the Hamas-run Health Authority said had killed hundreds of Palestinians.

Hamas officials in Gaza blamed an Israeli airstrike, saying hundreds were killed. Israel denied it was involved and released a flurry of video, audio and other information that it said showed the blast was instead due to a rocket misfire by Islamic Jihad, another militant group operating in Gaza. Islamic Jihad dismissed the Israeli claim.

The Associated Press has not independently verified any of the claims or evidence.

US President Joe Biden, who visited Israel on Wednesday, said data from his Defense Department showed the explosion was not likely caused by an Israeli airstrike. The White House later said an analysis of “overhead imagery, intercepts and open-source information” showed Israel was not behind the attack. But the US continues to collect evidence.

Video from the scene showed the hospital grounds strewn with torn bodies, many of them young children. Hundreds of wounded were rushed to Gaza City’s main hospital, where doctors already facing critical supply shortages were sometimes forced to perform surgery on the floors, often without anesthesia.

More than 1 million Palestinians, roughly half of Gaza’s population, have fled their homes in Gaza City and other places in the northern part of the territory since Israel told them to evacuate. Most have crowded into U.N.-run school shelters or the homes of relatives.

Hundreds of people are feared dead after an explosion at a hospital in the Gaza Strip on the fateful night of October 17, little over a week after the Palestinian group Hamas staged a terrorist attack on Israel that killed 1,400 people and led Israel to declare war.

The devastating impact of an explosion at the Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City on Tuesday became clearer only after the satellite images and videos were posted online.

The Hamas, which currently controls Gaza, attributed the blast to an Israeli airstrike. In contrast, Israel claimed it was caused by an errant rocket fired by another armed group, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which denied the accusation. On Wednesday, President Biden supported Israel's position, citing ""the data I was shown by my Defense Department.""

Online images and videos present varying narratives of the same event. Nonetheless, by examining post-strike images and utilising satellite imagery from Maxar Technologies, it is possible to construct an accurate depiction of the incident and map the extent of the damage caused by the strike.

The Akhil Bhartiya Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram has urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to commemorate the 100th birth anniversary of veteran tribal leader Kartik Oraon with the release of a special coin and a postal stamp in his honour.

 In a letter to the prime minister last week, the organisation's president Ramchandra Kharadi also proposed that Oraon's 100th birth anniversary be celebrated nationally ""as a day of remembrance and tribute to his remarkable life and services"".

 This national celebration would be a ""fitting recognition"" of Oraon's legacy and the values he stood for, Kharadi said, adding that this will also help in ""mitigating a sense of alienation and unrest among a section of Scheduled Tribes (STs), particularly the youths"".

 The Akhil Bhartiya Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram is an affiliate of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the ideological fountainhead of the Bharatiya Janata Party ruling at the Centre.

 ""His (Kartik Oraon's) life and contributions are a source of inspiration not only for Janjatis (tribals) but for all the people across India. His legacy extends beyond political achievements and encapsulates a commitment to the welfare and empowerment of marginalised communities, particularly Janjatis,"" the letter read.

 Oraon, also popularly known as Baba Kartik Saheb, was born on October 29, 1924 at Karounda Littatoli in Gumla district of the erstwhile state of Bihar (now Jharkhand) and passed away on December 8, 1981.

 ""In light of the 100th birth anniversary of Kartik Oraon, Akhil Bhartiya Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram respectfully requests the government of India to consider commemorating this occasion with a special coin and a postal stamp in his honor,"" Kharadi said in the letter.

 ""Such a tribute would not only acknowledge his significant contributions but also serve as an enduring symbol of inspiration for generations to come, particularly the Janjatis,"" he added.

NEW DELHI: The central government has asked states that they have no power to impose any tax or duty on electricity generated from any source - coal, hydro, wind or solar and any such levy is illegal and unconstitutional. In a circular, the Union Ministry of Power on October 25, said it had come to the notice of the central government that some state governments had imposed additional charges on generation of electricity from various sources under the guise of development free/charges/fund.
""Such additional charges/fees in the form of any tax/duty on the generation of electricity, which encompasses all types of generation viz thermal, hydro, wind, solar, nuclear etc is illegal and unconstitutional,"" it said.
Clarifying the constitutional position, the ministry said the powers to levy taxes/duties are specifically stated in the VII Schedule.
""List-II of the VII Schedule lists the powers of levying taxes/duties by the states in entries 45 to 63. No taxes/duties which have not been specifically mentioned in this list can be levied by the state governments under any guise whatsoever - as residuary powers are with the central government,"" it said.

Entry 53 of the List-II (State List) authorises the states to levy taxes on the consumption or sale of electricity in its jurisdiction.
""This does not include the power to impose any tax or duty on the generation of electricity. This is because electricity generated within the territory of one state may be consumed in other states and no state has the power to levy taxes/duties on residents of other states,"" the order said.

The ministry went on to state that Article 286 of the Constitution explicitly prohibits states from imposing any taxes/duties on the supply of goods or services or on both, where the supply takes place outside the state.
Also, Articles 287 and 288 prohibit the imposition of taxes on the consumption or sale of electricity consumed by the Central government or sold to the Central government for consumption by the government or its agencies.

""In light of the constitutional provisions, no taxes/duties can be levied by any state on generation or inter-state supply of electricity under the guise of additional charges/free on generation of electricity from any source - thermal, hydro or renewables,"" the orders said.

The Central government asked states to promptly remove any kind of tax/duty/cess levied in the guise of development free/charges/fund on generation or electricity from any sources.

In April, the Ministry had asked states not to levy or impose any tax or duty on the generation of electricity, especially from hydro projects.

""Some states have imposed taxes/duties on the generation of electricity under the guise of levying a cess on the use of water for generating electricity.


""However, though the state may call it a water cess, it is actually a tax on the generation of electricity - the tax is to be collected from the consumers of electricity who may happen to be residents in other states,"" the power ministry had said on April 25.

Any imposition of tax on the non-consumptive use of water of these rivers for electricity generation is in violation of provisions of the Constitution, it argued.


Stating that most of the hydroelectric plants in the states are located on inter-state rivers, the ministry had stated that hydropower projects do not consume water to produce electricity. Electricity is generated by directing the flow of water through a turbine which generates electricity - on the same principle as electricity from wind projects where wind is utilized to turn the turbine to produce electricity.


Therefore, the ministry had said that there is no rationale for the levy of water cess or air cess.

Mumbai: As India approaches the May 3 deadline for lifting the nationwide lockdown, top epidemiologists are divided over the future course of Covid-19 management and the strategy to be followed in getting the country back to work.
Two veteran infectious diseases experts — Jayaprakash Muliyal and T Jacob John, who were at the forefront of the leprosy eradication and pulse polio immunisation programmes, respectively — feel it’s time to end the lockdown, with one of them describing a long-term shutdown as akin to ‘burning the house to kill a rat’.
Experts from the official health establishment, however, advocate phased relief, with strict containment measures guided by surveillance mechanisms. They warn that achieving ‘herd immunity’ is a costly proposition that will result in a surge of positive cases, which will overwhelm the healthcare system.My advice is: Keep the elderly out of the picture for the time being, as the disease hurts them the most. So, we quarantine the old for two-three months and let the youngsters get to work,” Muliyal told ET.
“Several of them will fall ill, unfortunately, but there will be adequate space in hospitals to treat them. So, mortality can be further reduced. And then, we reach the point of saturation, or herd immunity,” he added.
Act of Stopping Time: T Jacob John
Muliyal has been a big proponent of the ‘herd immunity’ concept. This is a strategy where you let natural immunisation take place by a large population contracting the disease, thereby halting the spread of the infection.
This controversial concept was initially promoted by UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, before the country reversed its stance on the issue. Recent random antibody testing in New York reveals that 20% of that city’s population may have contracted Covid-19 and recovered on its own.
According to Muliyal, herd immunity may already be developing in India as reports come in of people with sub-clinical and mildly clinical symptoms. “Along with epidemic, the natural immunisation process is also going on… all I am saying is, don’t forget that,” he said, adding the country needs to worry about availability of beds in hospitals. This disease seems to spare the young, as mortality rates in that segment are very low, Muliyal said.
John described the lockdown as an act of stopping time. “It just froze time. Once you unfreeze time, whatever you stopped day before the lockdown, it will pick up. So, lockdown is not simply for reducing the transmission or flattening the curve, it is because you need time to prepare. And if you didn’t prepare in two weeks, you won’t be prepared in four weeks either,” he told ET.
John compared the lockdown effort for hunting the virus to the story of a ‘clever man’, who burnt down a house to kill a rat. “The lockdown was good for two weeks, three weeks was the upper limit. Anything more than that will be like burning the house down,” he said.
At the other end of the spectrum, two experts who are part of the National Task Force of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said the country needs to get used to a new normal.
The best post-lockdown strategy is to implement phased relief, with stricter containment measures guided by strong surveillance mechanisms. Herd immunity as a concept is mostly theoretical at this stage since reinfections are known to exist in communities that have had the infection earlier,” said Giridhara Babu, an infectious diseases expert with the Public Health Foundation of India.
""I think the lockdown has been successful in keeping the burden low, helping in preparedness and scaling up testing. It has proven most models predicting a worse scenario wrong,” said Sanjay Pujari, director of the Institute of Infectious Diseases.
Pujari said herd immunity may be a good concept for infections with low morbidity and fatality rates. But in case of Covid-19, trying to achieve herd immunity will lead to a surge in cases which will overwhelm health systems.

Israeli forces backed by fighter jets and drones carried out a second ground raid into Gaza in as many days and struck targets on the outskirts of Gaza City, the military said Friday, as it prepares for a widely expected ground invasion of the Hamas-ruled territory.

US warplanes meanwhile struck targets in eastern Syria that the Pentagon said were linked to Iran's Revolutionary Guard after a string of attacks on US forces by Iran-backed fighters, adding to the already high regional tensions fueled by the three-week-old Gaza war.

The Palestinian death toll has soared past 7,000 as Israel has carried out waves of devastating airstrikes in response to a bloody Hamas incursion into southern Israel on Oct 7. The Health Ministry in Gaza, which tracks the toll, released a detailed list of names and ID numbers on Thursday. The toll includes more than 2,900 minors and more than 1,500 women.

The overall number of deaths far exceeds the combined toll of all four previous wars between Israel and Hamas, estimated at around 4,000.

More than 1,400 people in Israel, mostly civilians, were slain during the initial Hamas attack, according to the Israeli government. Hamas is holding at least 229 captives inside Gaza, including men, women, children and older adults.

The airstrikes have flattened entire neighborhoods, causing a level of death and destruction unseen in the last four wars between Israel and Hamas. Over a million people have fled their homes, with many heeding Israeli orders to evacuate to the south, despite continuing Israeli strikes across the sealed-off territory.

The humanitarian crisis sparked by the war and the Israeli siege has sparked protests across the region, and more demonstrations were expected later Friday after weekly Muslim prayers.

The military said ground forces raided inside Gaza, striking dozens of militant targets over the past 24 hours. It said aircraft and artillery bombed targets in Shijaiyah, a neighborhood on the outskirts of Gaza City that was the scene of a bloody urban battle in the 2014 Gaza war.

The military said the soldiers exited the territory without suffering any casualties. It reported an earlier raid into northern Gaza early Thursday, saying ground forces battled militants and struck anti-tank missile firing positions in an operation that lasted hours.

Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, an Israeli military spokesman, said the raids enable forces to “uncover the enemy,” to kill militants and to remove explosives and launch pads. The aim is “to prepare the ground for the next stages of the war,” he added.

The damage to Gaza from nearly three weeks of bombardment showed in satellite photos of several locations taken before the war and again in recent days.

Entire rows of residential buildings simply disappear in the photos, reduced to smears of dust and rubble. A complex of 13 high-rises by the sea was pounded to dust near Gaza City's al-Shati refugee camp, leaving only a few tottering bits of facade. Just down the street, hardly anything remained in what had been a neighborhood of low-built homes on winding lanes, according to the photos by Maxar Technologies.

The military says it only strikes militant targets and accuses Hamas of operating among civilians in an attempt to protect its fighters. The Israeli military said an airstrike killed one of two masterminds of the Oct. 7 massacre, Shadi Barud, the head of Hamas' intelligence unit.

Palestinian militants have fired thousands of rockets into Israel since the war began.

Hamas' military wing said Thursday that Israeli bombardment has so far killed about 50 of the hostages. There was no immediate comment from Israeli officials, who have denied previous, similar claims.

The conflict has threatened to ignite a wider war across the region.

Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed ally of Hamas in Lebanon, has repeatedly traded fire with Israel along the border, and Israel has carried out airstrikes targeting Iran-linked groups in Syria. The United States has sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the region, along with additional fighter jets and other weaponry and personnel, in part to deter Iran and its allies from entering the war on the side of Hamas.

U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the strikes in eastern Syria were “a response to a series of ongoing and mostly unsuccessful attacks against U.S. Personnel in Iraq and Syria by Iranian-backed militia groups that began on Oct. 17.”

He said President Joe Biden directed the narrowly tailored strikes “to make clear that the United States will not tolerate such attacks and will defend itself, its personnel and its interests.” He added that the operation was separate and distinct from Israel's war against Hamas.

Syrian opposition activists in the area said the two locations are associated with Iranian arms shipments to militant groups in the region, and had been evacuated ahead of the strikes. There were no immediate reports of casualties.

Egyptian state media reported that six people were lightly wounded when a rocket slammed into a medical building in the town of Taba, on the border with Israel. It was not immediately known who fired the projectile.

Hagari, the Israeli military spokesperson, said “an aerial threat was identified in the area of the Red Sea,” which appeared to be the source of the blast in Egypt. He said fighter jets were dispatched to the area and that Israel, Egypt and the U.S. Were tightening their defenses in the region.

Last week, a U.S. Navy destroyer in the northern Red Sea shot down three cruise missiles and several drones launched toward Israel by Iran-backed Houthi rebels in northern Yemen.

In Gaza, supplies of food, medicine and fuel for powering emergency generators are running low. The U.N. Agency for Palestinian refugees, which provides basic services to hundreds of thousands of people, including operating schools turned into shelters, has said it may run out of fuel within days.

Gaza's sole power station shut down for lack of fuel days after the start of the war, and Israel has barred all fuel deliveries, saying it believes Hamas would steal them for military purposes.

About 1.4 million of Gaza's 2.3 million residents have fled their homes, with nearly half of them crowding into U.N. Shelters. Hundreds of thousands remain in northern Gaza, despite Israel ordering them to evacuate to the south and saying that those who remain might be considered “accomplices” of Hamas.

In recent days, Israel has let more than 70 trucks with aid enter from Egypt through the Rafah crossing, the only entry point into Gaza not controlled by Israel. But aid workers say the convoys meet only a tiny fraction of the territory's mounting humanitarian needs. Before the war, an average of 500 trucks entered Gaza each day.

The U.S. Has been working with other mediators to send in more humanitarian aid, but Israel is demanding strict screening to make sure none falls into the hands of Hamas. The U.S. Says Hamas has meanwhile refused to open the Gaza side of the Rafah crossing to let hundreds of foreign passport holders leave.

The United States on Friday expanded its effort to cut off funding for Hamas, announcing a second round of sanctions against people and organisations linked to the group since it launched an attack on Israel that killed more than 1,400 people.

The new sanctions highlight Iran's role in providing financial, logistical and operational support to Hamas, the US Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control said in a statement.

They include a Hamas representative in Iran and members of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard.

The sanctions were announced as Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo travelled to London to shore up support from Britain, one of America's closest allies, for the drive to squeeze off funding for Hamas, which both countries consider a terrorist organisation.

“Today's action underscores the United States' commitment to dismantling Hamas's funding networks by deploying our counterterrorism sanctions authorities and working with our global partners to deny Hamas the ability to exploit the international financial system,” Adeyemo said.

Among those targeted are Khaled Qaddoumi, described as a liaison between Hamas and the Iranian government; and Ali Morshed Shirazi and Mostafa Mohammad Khani, officials in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' Qods Force who are accused of training and assisting Hamas fighters.

The US also sanctioned a number of organisations, including the Iranian Bonyad Shahid, also known as the Martyrs Foundation. US officials say the group, which is affiliated with Palestinian Islamic Jihad, funnels millions of dollars through the Gaza-based Al-Ansar Charity Association for the families of militants.

The practice “ultimately serves as a recruiting tool for terrorist activities”, the US said.

The sanctions freeze any US-based assets owned or controlled by the named individuals and organisations. They also block financial transactions with those designated and prohibit the contribution of funds, goods and services to them.

El Salvador is charging passengers from Africa or India a $1,000 (over Rs 80,000) fee, in an apparent bid to curb migration to the US through the Central American country.
People traveling on passports from India or any one of more than 50 African nations will be obliged to pay the fee, El Salvador’s port authority said in a statement on its website dated October 20.
The money raised will be used to improve the nation’s main international airport, the authority added.
El Salvador President Nayib Bukele this week met Brian Nichols, US assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs, to discuss “efforts to address irregular migration,” among other topics. US Customs and Border Patrol encountered a record 3.2 million migrants across the country in fiscal year 2023, which ended in September.

Many migrants from Africa and elsewhere make it to the US via Central America.


Including VAT, the additional cost is $1,130 from travelers from the affected countries. The new fee took effect October 23 and was imposed due to increased use of the country’s main international airport, according to the statement.

Airlines will be required to notify Salvadoran authorities daily of passengers who come from a list of 57 countries in Africa, and India.


Colombian airline Avianca, which is one of the hub’s biggest users, began notifying travelers that passengers from the list of countries must pay the mandatory fee before boarding flights to El Salvador.","In the Arnia sector of Jammu and Kashmir, a Border Security Force (BSF) personnel sustained minor injuries in unprovoked firing by Pakistan Rangers.

AMRITSAR: The act of showering rose petals from a helicopter over the Golden Temple in Amritsar has triggered controversy and concerns, with some Sikh groups perceiving it as a violation of maryada (Sikh code of religious conduct) and a compromise to the temple's security.
Advocate Neena Singh, a member of Sikh Legal Aid (SLA), raised concerns about maintaining religious sanctity and the safety protocols of the Golden Temple. She emphasized that, given the sensitivity of the holy place, flights should not be allowed near or over the Golden Temple.

Neena also criticized the lack of religious decorum during the petal shower, pointing out that those involved did not cover their heads, indicating disrespect. She stated that it appeared as if they were on a joyride, which was highly objectionable.
The petal shower was organized by one Kuljit Singh, a Sikh devotee from Chamba in Himachal Pradesh, during the nagar kirtan (religious procession) on the birth anniversary of Sikh's fourth guru, Guru Ram Das.
Social media users, including those on X (formerly Twitter), expressed their discontent with the flower-showering act. Some criticized the lack of head coverings and emphasized the need for reverence in such a sacred place.

Neena has written letters to both the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) and the jathedar of Akal Takht, urging them not to allow aerial vehicles over the Golden Temple to ensure its security.


Kuljit Singh, who organized the petal shower, explained that the head cover was blown off due to a sudden gust of wind when the helicopter door was opened. He stated that they had obtained permission from both the SGPC and the district administration for the activity and would not have proceeded if there were any bans in place.

However, some Sikh bodies do not see any violation of maryada or security concerns in this act.


Balwinder Singh of the Hawara Committee mentioned that helicopters have flown over the Golden Temple in the past, and he did not perceive any violation of maryada during high-altitude flights over the temple.

Bengaluru: To ensure safe sale of crackers for Deepavali, the BBMP has identified 70 playgrounds where 426 temporary shops will be set up.

The Palike had submitted the list of grounds and shops that will be allowed in each to the police commissioner’s office. Cops will get a fire-safety report from the fire and emergency services before calling applications from those interested to open cracker shops.

These safety measures are being taken in the wake of the firecracker warehouse blaze at Attibele that claimed 17 lives in October. A drive after the tragedy had identified violations at several cracker establishments.

BBMP chief commissioner Tushar Giri Nath said zonal officials had been asked to identify safe playgrounds to set up cracker shops. Officials accordingly inspected the spots and prepared a list of playgrounds and number of shops to be opened.

Nath said he submitted the zonal-wise list to the police commissioner’s office. According to the list, east zone may have the highest number of shops — 101 on 23 grounds. South zone is likely to have 87 and Bommanahalli zone may get the least (six on three grounds).

It's Aishwarya Rai Bachchan's birthday today and the actress made the most of this special day by spending time with Cancer patients. The actress has associated herself with this cause of doing something for people suffering from Cancer and on her birthday today, she attended a special event organised by GSB Seva Mandal. Aishwarya was seen attending this event with her mother Vrinda Rai and daughter Aaradhya Bachchan.
The actress made a gorgeous appearance and looked ethereal in white. On this day, while addressing the crowds and media, Aishwarya revealed that her mother was suffering from Cancer earlier this year but is fine now. She said, ""Okay, I don't know if I should be saying this, but Cancer has touched our lives personally. First it was my dad and my mum got it earlier this year but she has come out of it, with the support of so many incredible doctors and a lot of love and blessings from everyone.""
She further added, ""But that is not the reason why we are working towards the cause of cancer patients. One doesn't really work towards something if it affects them, we've been associated with this cause earlier too and the fact that my mother also went through it was incidental.""
The actress further felt gratitude to be able to spend her day in such a special manner. ""I couldn't see today becoming memorable in any other way. It'll continue to be my way of life to be able to do my karm and be there in anyway I can for people in my life and anyone's life who I can touch. I just had to stand here and through the members of the media, express gratitude to everyone who has touched my life, all the professionals I've worked with who gave me the opportunity to be able to stand as a personality on a public platform where I'm able to communicate, by the virtue of the work I've done. But more so, to the audience because of the support they've given me to be able to do anything that's impactful. To my audience - you give me the power, ability to enrich others' life but it's you who enrich my life.""
She cut the cake with the media and the cancer patients, however didn't eat the cake as she's fasting for karwa chauth today.

Thinkers worldwide are saying that a new path is needed.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday promised to get back every penny of the black money stashed abroad, days after his government was accused of making a U-turn on the issue.

He said the efforts to bring back black money stashed abroad are on the “right track” even as he acknowledged that there was no correct estimate about how much money is kept illegally in foreign countries.

In an address to the nation over radio, he said that bringing back black money from outside the country is an “article of faith” for him and nothing will be lacking in his efforts to do so.

The Prime Minister’s commitment to bring back black money stashed abroad comes against the backdrop of the stand it first took in the Supreme Court last week about the inability to disclose the names of the account holders in foreign banks because of the confidentially clause in treaties with other countries.

It had maintained that disclosure of details of account holders would hamper efforts to bring back black money.

The government beat a hasty retreat after the Supreme Court ordered it to disclose the names of account holders in HSBC Geneva which amounted to 627 in number. The government also came under attack from opposition parties that it was going back on its election promise to unearth and bring back black money stashed abroad.

Modi said there may be differences in approach on getting this money back but he was committed to doing it and the nation should have faith in him.

“As far as black money is concerned, you should have faith on this ‘Pradhan sevak’. For me, it is an article of faith. Every penny of the money of poor people in this country, which has gone out, should return. This is my commitment,” Modi said in ‘Mann ki Baat’ programme on All-India Radio.

“There may be differences over the approach and procedures, which is natural in a democracy. But as far as my understanding goes and on the basis of information I have, I can say we are on the right track,” he said.

On the actual estimate about amount in illegal bank accounts in foreign countries, the Prime Minister said, “Nobody knows, nor do I know, nor does the government know, nor do you know, how much money is stashed abroad. Even the previous government had no estimate.

“Everybody is making own assessment of figures. I do not want to get involved in those figures. It is my commitment that whatever amount, Rs 2, Rs 5, crore of rupees or whatever, this money belongs to the poor people of this country and should come back.

“And I can assure you that nothing will be lacking in my efforts. I only want your blessings to continue.”

He asserted that whatever has to be done, will be done at the earliest.

In his second radio address, which lasted about 20 minutes, the Prime Minister also talked about his government’s initiatives like those related to the specially-abled children and cleaning the country besides social problems like drug addiction.

He also paid tributes to the armed forces while referring to his visit to Siachen in Jammu and Kashmir on Diwali day on October 23, where soldiers live in difficult conditions.

With regard to the specially-abled people, he announced that a special scholarship will be given to 1,000 such children by the HRD Ministry.

One lakh rupees each will also be given to Kendriya Vidhyalayas and Central universities for creating infrastructure for the specially-abled children, he said.

“A good beginning has been made and things will change,” he said, adding that the country is headed towards a “big change“

Talking about the ‘Swachh Bharat’ drive launched on October 2, he appreciated the personalities from various walks of life as well as common people for participating in the campaign.

“Had anybody thought that it will become a nationwide campaign? ... Things are changing and people are becoming aware that they should not throw filth around,” Modi said, adding that the maximum impact of the drive has been on children.

Linking the cleanliness drive to healthcare, he said the poor people are the worst affected by dirt as they fall ill which affects their livelihood.

While talking about the changing mindset of people on the issue, he said that many personalities, including business leaders, sports persons and film actors who meet him now discuss social issues. — PTI

Donald Trump will likely surrender to the Manhattan District Attorney’s (DA) office early next week, his attorney Joe Tacopina told NBC News. Multiple sources familiar with the situation also said the former US President's legal team is in touch with prosecutors and his arraignment is also expected to take place next week.

A New York grand jury indicted Donald Trump on Thursday over hush money paid to pornstar Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 presidential election. He became the first US president to face criminal charges.
A spokesperson for the DA said they are already in contact with Trump's lawyer to arrange his surrender. ""We contacted Mr Trump’s attorney to coordinate his surrender to the Manhattan DA’s Office for arraignment on a Supreme Court indictment, which remains under seal,"" the spokesperson was quoted by NBC as saying.

To ensure a safe surrender, the Secret Service will coordinate with authorities in New York and Trump's legal team for his transportation and security needs.

The charges against Trump came after a years-long investigation into a payment made by his personal lawyer to porn star Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 presidential election. A grand jury voted to indict him after investigating a $130,000 pay-out to Stormy Daniels in an attempt to silence her over an alleged affair.


Trump has called the investigations ""political persecution"" and said he was ""completely innocent"".

Indian diplomatic missions in the UK, USA, Australia and Canada have recently been subjected to violent and abusive protests by pro-Khalistan Sikhs. If I were at Ground Zero, I would have simply walked around with a sheaf of foolscap papers and asked the agitators to write an essay about the proposed Khalistan. The essay must address the issues of territory, a form of government, the relationship between the state and church (SGPC), economy, demography (38 per cent non-Sikhs in Punjab, and Sikhs in the rest of India) etc. However, the essay reveals the “Khali-stan” (empty space) that exists in their minds.

Over the last 50 years, the ‘movement’ has preferred to dodge these fundamental questions. Thousands of lives have been lost in an organised misconception. Territory is the basic component of a sovereign state. The maps of the proposed Khalistan are ludicrous. In the 1980s, Khushwant Singh purchased a Khalistan map published in England, for £2. “According to this map”, he wrote in 1992, “Khalistan will include Jammu, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, New Delhi, chunks of UP, Rajasthan and Saurashtra to give the state an outlet to the sea. By rough reckoning, the Sikh population will be 13 per cent. What kind of Sikh state will this be? Clearly, not democratic.” (My Bleeding Punjab, P.155-156).

A recent example of this lack of clarity is the fanciful Khalistan map issued by Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, of Sikhs For Justice, in June 2022 at the Lahore Press Club. Besides the Indian Punjab, it encompasses almost the whole of Haryana, Himachal, five Rajasthan districts, several Uttarakhand districts (including Dehradun and Haridwar), and a number of districts of UP. It included Gurugram, though Delhi was left out. Shimla was the capital of Khalistan, though Sikhs comprised 1.95 per cent of the city. Pro-Khalistani graffiti was actually found pasted on the Assembly Building at Dharamsala (Kangra district) on May 8, 2022, and scribes in Himachal Pradesh received pre-recorded Khalistani threat calls on their mobiles. However, in the Melbourne round of a referendum by the outfit in January, the question was whether “Indian-governed Punjab should be an independent country— Yes or No”. Where does that leave the June 2022 map?

As per the referendum, sovereign Khalistan would be a landlocked country between India and Pakistan. Punjab farmers, overwhelmingly Jatt Sikhs, are heavily dependent on rice and wheat from the Centre. This was borne out by the massive farmers’ agitation (2020-21) compelling the Government to cancel the farm laws. One would be interested in knowing how Khalistan proponents plan to offload Punjab rice and wheat mounds.

Nobody has yet seen a draft Khalistan constitution even after 50 years. The Khalsa Raj Party Constitution issued by Lt Col Partap Singh (Retd) on May 15, 1991, at Chandigarh, issued towards the end of the Khalistani insurgency, was expected to condense all wisdom on Khalistan. It advocates an independent, sovereign Sikh homeland and restricts its boundaries to Punjab and adjoining Punjabi-speaking areas ‘fraudulently kept out during a Punjab reorganisation in 1966”. Herein, Lt Col Singh assumes all Punjabi-speaking persons in India are Sikhs, and vice versa, wherein in reality 38 per cent of Punjab population according to Census 2011 is Hindu.

Will Khalistan be a democracy and a theocracy at the same time? It is open to multiple interpretations but it says nothing about the SGPC. The ‘movement’ is a bundle of imponderables, deliberately retained by its sponsors. It fits American author Paul Elridge’s description, “Man is willing to die for any idea, provided that idea is not clear to him.”

India’s vision of a ‘Look East’ policy and Japan’s vision regarding a free and open Indo Pacific meet in India’s landlocked northeast. India for long has championed its ‘Look East’ policy. This aims to develop deeper relations with countries in South East Asia and the Bay of Bengal region through northeastern (much to be tapped) States as a major gateway. Meanwhile, for more than a decade, Japan has been focusing on free, open and fair Indo Pacific policy, with emphasis on free movement of people, trade across land, sea and air routes, all through the region. India's northeastern States form an important access node.

Last week Japanese Prime Minister Kishida, during his India visit, reemphasised the desire to pursue a more engaged Indo Pacific policy. This has for the past two years become the most strategic foreign policy component for the US and Europe. It is also the glue holding together India, US, Australia and Japan in their QUAD grouping.

Japan has been promoting key infrastructure projects in India’s northeast to create seamless trade and transport routes. It has been assisting in developing northeast road network connectivity improvement projects in Assam and Meghalaya, sewage and water supply projects in Assam, development of schools in Manipur, projects related to forest management in Tripura and Nagaland and sustainable agriculture projects in Mizoram. Japan’s investment in the northeast is $2 billion so far. In addition, the Japanese Government has picked up key infrastructure projects such as the MatarBari deep water port in Bangladesh. This will be complemented by the construction of connecting roads in Assam, Mizoram and Tripura. Once completed, these infrastructure projects would provide seamless access from the northeast to Bay of Bengal sea ports. In addition, they would serve as a major trade transit route for goods from Southeast Asia and beyond.

 This promises to bring more prosperity to the entire region, not just within India's geographical boundaries. It fits well into the Japanese vision of comprehensive economic and regional development, based on law. It may be noteworthy that the other Asian giant, China, has rapidly expanded its sphere of influence in the region through its opaque Belt and Road Initiative. This has tied many of these countries into multiyear fatal debt traps. India and Japan are the major economies not part of China's debt trap infrastructure financing projects. Their vision for the Indo Pacific is different from China’s.

India and Japan, during the leadership meeting in New Delhi, highlighted the need for expanding the partnership to more ASEAN countries. Even the QUAD Foreign Ministers’ meeting in March emphasised the centrality of ASEAN and the need for greater engagement. It is significant that Japan is working in a structured manner in India’s neighbourhood. This is with some of India’s most trusted allies such as Bangladesh on a path of regional prosperity. Japan has been working with India since 2017 to support NE’s development. Japan has clearly articulated that it is keen to tie the two ports, one in Bangladesh and the other in India’s NE, for greater economic cooperation.

Meanwhile, Minister of State for External Affairs Rajkumar Ranjan Singh while addressing a BIMSTEC meet in Kolkata this week stressed the need for India’s north eastern region to be the leading edge of India’s Act East diplomacy. He emphasised the need for developing transportation facilities and trade within BIMSTEC partners. His caution for BIMSTEC countries was to follow a modest yet practical approach. Any creative solutions for increasing trade in this region also click well with Japan’s push for increased economic prosperity and connectivity for the Indo Pacific.

The 10-day Habitat International Film Festival (HIFF) was a visual treat for film-loving communities in Delhi and the NCR. Thanks to Sunit Tandon (Director, India Habitat Centre) and Vidyun Singh (Programme Head) along with her team to bring the award-winning, critically acclaimed films from Cannes, Berlin and other renowned film festivals.

This year, HIFF screened 60 films from 20 countries, with Australia as the focus country. From factual to fantastical, from surreal to sci-fi, this edition took place from March 17 to 26.

Tandon says, “The HIFF is back in its full-fledged form this year. We also bring a cutting-edge VR Section to the festival for the first time. Aspiring filmmakers will not want to miss the unique opportunity provided by Kieslowski Film School Documentary Workshop.”

From Australia, six of the finest contemporary films of 2022 and 2023 have been screened with the opening film, The Dreamlife of Georgie Stone, showcasing the elliptical memories of the teen activist’s historic fight for transgender rights; Ivan Sen’s Limbo arrives fresh off the boat from its Berlinale 2023 premiere; others include The Lonely Spirits Variety Hour, Sweet As, and Survival of Kindness.

Filmmakers and editors from the Kielowski Film School from Poland trained the young minds in a four-day documentary workshop. Grzegorz Paprzycki, an acclaimed upcoming voice in contemporary Polish cinema and Kieslowski Film School alumni was one of the workshop trainers. A hands-on workshop, with live editing sessions, discussions and practical exercises designed to hone their skills as filmmakers was an added advantage for the local young filmmakers.

For the first time as part of the festival, cinema’s latest innovation — VR and 360° video — was presented in partnership with the Goethe Institute. The Virtual Reality programme — a package of animation, short and documentary films — explores the relationship between the past and present. It also adds a whole new dimension to film watching for the audience.

Four films in the MUBI Friday section that approach the anarchy of love and its expression across different eras — the classic In The Mood For Love by Wong Kar-wai, to the contemporary Paris, 13th district by Jacques Audiard and The Worst Person in the World by Joachim Trier, even the futuristic Crimes of The Future by David Cronenberg.

Eight biggest attraction at HIFF were: Elvis, the buzzing Austin Butler-starrer, Baz Luhrmann biopic that premiered at Cannes (and has won many awards subsequently); Rheingold, Fatih Akin’s (Germany, Netherlands, Morocco, Mexico) high-octane adaptation of the swagger and bombast of German rap star Xatar’s 2015 autobiography ‘All Or Nothing’; winner of 16 awards and 51 nominations, including the much-coveted Golden Bear (Berlinale 2022) - Carla Simón’s (Spain), Alcarras, a deeply intelligent and empathetic humane drama that engulfs you in the heat and dust and dysfunction created by market forces; Perfect Number - the return of veteran Polish filmmaker Krzysztof Zanussi and his search for philosophical answers in mathematical theories; the poignant We are Still Here, an anthology film about stories of indigenous heroes from Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific; winner of the Best Screenplay at Cannes 2022, Boy From Heaven, takes us into the heart of a ruthless power struggle between Egypt's religious and political elites; the latest Berlinale awardee (2023), The Survival of Kindness, follows a black woman’s escape from a cage in the middle of the desert to the city, recapture, and tragedy; and Oscar nominee 'EO' by Jerzy Skolimowski (Poland) follows a donkey that encounters good and bad people, experiences joy and pain, exploring a vision of modern Europe.

Further enriching the feature line-up are some equally remarkable documentaries, shorts, and animation films. DOC NYC 2022 nominee Closed Circuit by Tel Inbar (Israel) is a documentary that captures the heart-pounding trauma of the 2016 terrorist attack in Tel Aviv’s Sarona Market; Winner of ‘Best Documentary Feature’ at The Roxbury International Film Festival and Filmocracy Fest, Hostile by UK filmmaker Sonita Gale explores the UK’s complicated relationship with its migrant communities; Winner at the Warsaw Film Festival 2022, Region of Heroes by Artur Lerman (Ukraine) is the story of those who selflessly saved thousands of Ukrainians during the Russian occupation; winner of the Special Jury Award at Roxbury Film Festival and the International Humanitarian Award at Flickers’ Rhode Island International Film Festival, The Bengali by Kavery Kaul (USA) is the story of a writer from Louisiana who embarks on a quest to India to look for her grandfather's descendants. Curated packages from Poland and Sri Lanka also embellished the festival.","India's ""Look East"" policy and Japan's ""free and open Indo-Pacific"" vision intersect in India's northeastern region. Japan, during Prime Minister Kishida's visit, expressed a commitment to a more engaged Indo-Pacific strategy, aligning with the US, Europe, India, and Australia's QUAD grouping. Japan has invested $2 billion in the Indian northeast, promoting infrastructure projects and trade routes. This collaboration aims to bring prosperity to the entire region and counter China's debt-trap initiatives in Asia. The focus on expanding partnerships with ASEAN countries and connecting ports in India and Bangladesh underscores the commitment to regional development and economic cooperation. India's northeastern region plays a crucial role in these diplomatic efforts.

The BJP is looking for a home run no doubt but its latest momentum on the Ram temple at Ayodhya or its craftsmanship of a people-friendly budget, howsoever temporary, indicate the burden that none of the Opposition parties has to carry, that of holding out its report card. In short, how much of an achche din was it able to usher, rather how many achche dins in the five-year tenure? So its exam rush hyperactivity is understandable in making up for a paltry performance in comparison to the decisive verdict of 2014, one that no ruling party enjoyed over the last decade. By that measure, that chasm is wide indeed.

The Ram Mandir is an emotionally galvanising force that had got the Sangh Parivar close to claiming political power through the BJP. But governance demanded pragmatism and through the Vajpayee and Modi years, Ayodhya has at best been cannon fodder for rhetoric and a subject of ideological reverence given the legal complexities concerned. And fringe issues like gauraksha or polarisation have been more of an embarrassment and headache than serving the Hindu cause over the last few years. But now that the party’s development agenda doesn’t look shiny enough, post the electoral debacle in the heartland States, and it needs to re-energise its cadres relying on the RSS grassroots network, it has to be seen as being purposeful about the temple. This has become necessary after the downbeat mood of workers at the last parliamentary party meeting hit home. Besides, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat and even old ally Shiv Sena have launched a pincer attack on the unfulfilled promise of a Ram temple, saying that would, if not anything, address the BJP’s reason for being. Even the BJP’s latest plea of returning the superfluous land outside the disputed site in Ayodhya to owners is fraught with legal interjections, some claiming that the fate of that too is linked to a decision on the title suit. But the party brass is hoping it will at least be seen as attempting a closure within legal perimeters, even if not entirely successful. Politically, it would allow it to neutralise a resurgent Congress, which is itself pursuing soft Hindutva. In fact, the Congress is on the backfoot on Ayodhya and has refused TV debates on the subject.

However, Modi’s bigger concern is the electorate which feels betrayed and comprises the poor, both rural and urban, and the middle classes. The temple, as ground surveys indicate, is hardly expected to wash off on an aspirational society, more interested in livelihood indices than identity. And with Congress chief Rahul Gandhi having already floated the idea of a universal basic income, the BJP has to be seen as a healer given the crippling intensity of farm distress and the cascading effects of demonestisation. There is talk of the interim Budget promising direct money transfers to farmers’ accounts, waiving off interest on crop loans for farmers who pay on time, revising tax slabs and even announcing relief for petroleum companies to arrest fuel prices. Of course, nobody is asking where the money will come from. But will last-minute affirmative action and a veiled election manifesto work for the BJP government? The Indian voter has become much too aware to be enchanted by the gimmickry of grants and sops. It was precisely because they were tired of these populist fruits dangled by previous regimes that they gave a monolithic verdict hoping that the Modi government would have the mandate to take decisive steps. Alas, those came few and far between adventurist moves and the report card, in the end, has a repetitive feel about it. Faith takes time to build, just a moment to destroy. Modi was seen as a tall leader, still is. Hence the expectation of him to be less formulaic and not resort to cliches. Particularly of the 11th hour kind.

The most significant thing about India’s rise — by three ranks — to the 78th position in Transparency International’s corruption perceptions index is the fact that the country has jumped past its bigger Eastern neighbour, China. In fact, the Middle Kingdom has dropped dramatically in the corruption rankings. Predictably, the communist media will dismiss the report but the fact is that under President Xi Jinping, who made fighting corruption a supposed cornerstone of his administration, the unscrupulous boomed thanks to projects like the Belt and Road Initiative. Corruption in China was just a stick used by Xi to eliminate his political rivals. However, India’s slight rise overtaking China is also a sign that under the Narendra Modi dispensation, there has been a palpable sense that large-scale political corruption reduced. This is not to say that every estate of the Indian state, including the fourth estate, the media, is riddled with scams. But as they say, we must take baby steps to start with.

India’s problem is not just of corruption across the executive but that the malaise has taken root in society much like an invasive plant species and it is extremely difficult to remove it. The current state of Indian banks because of their profligate lending habits was in no small part due to questionable understanding between parties. Besides one has to understand that corruption is not always a case of money changing hands, it is also that network of favours. A job for a relative, school admission for a child, the worst forms of a corrupt system rarely involve money. Removing that will take years of work and a mindset change that everything, from chai-pani as the telephone lineman once asked for just to do his job to the payoffs for contracts, is wrong and that means teaching children at a very young age that corruption is bad. But in a country with an economic disparity as wide as that in India, eliminating corruption is almost impossible. That does not mean that we should not do our utmost to try and reduce it. There is little authentic economic data to prove this but rough calculations made by anti-corruption watchdogs show that we lose a percentage point or more of growth every year thanks to graft cases. Because it almost always benefits a few at the cost of the many. The poor municipal roads and potholes courtesy the a contractor ‘mafia’ in many cities are evidence of this. So yes, while we should be pleased with our rise and have a bit of schadenfreude about China's decline, we should not lose sight of the fact that the road ahead to reducing corruption is a long and a hard one.

While travelling across central India, especially through the Western Ghats, one will not fail to observe the clear-cut changes made to the topography of the region. The lush, green forests and the tree canopy have all steadily declined in the last few years. Vegetation has given way to more dusty, dry-looking land that seems to exist throughout the year. The meandering forest streams that once used to punctuate the verdant forests have all dried up along with the forest cover. As the Indian hinterland shows some changes that are in tune with worsening climate change, the world itself is realising that a much larger problem — thanks to rapid climate change — is knocking on the door, which is the issue of rapid desertification.

As greening and afforestation measures have proved to be an uphill task, desertification is fast making an already difficult battle even tougher. This aspect was very much evident during the recent 17th Session of the Committee for the Review of the Implementation (CRIC17) of the United Nation’s Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) in Guyana. The gathering understood the need for emergency steps to stop desertification that now grips almost all countries around the world.

The preliminary assessment report circulated by the Secretariat of the UNCCD found that in the first 15 years of the millennium, 20 per cent of the world’s productive and healthy land was degraded. This seemingly low-level threat has now cornered 169 countries in its grip, leading to rapid land degradation and impacting nearly 3.2 billion people economically. The assessment was made on the basis of data submitted by 135 countries. In October, 2015, after the world adopted the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the 12th Conference of parties to UNCCD endorsed the SDG target 15.3. Under this target lies a new concept called land degradation neutrality, according to which, countries are attempting to halt land degradation through desertification.

One of the crucial aspects to containing desertification is to understand the speed and area of concentration of the deserted land and the factors that trigger the same. Moreover, besides adversely impacting the people economically, degraded lands and soils pose a severe threat to the provision of ecosystem services and economic development globally. Given the gravity of the problem, in the last four years alone, 82 countries, including India, have committed to stop land degradation by 2030. But without an adequate plan for land governance, education, demography and land use planning, this ambitious target seems difficult to be achieved.

In order to attain meaningful progress in controlling desertification, instead of treating the symptoms of land degradation, India must focus on the causes. The immediate cause that typically triggers desertification is the loss of primary vegetation. Most lands fall prey to mining and other unnatural activities which result in the removal of vegetation due to human activities.

Sustained lack of green cover causes a dry land to develop an arid nature and eventually results in what can be termed as the “death of the topsoil.” This renders re-growth of any greenery almost impossible and leaves the land degraded.

Then there are also other factors that drive the disappearance of the green cover such as drought, climatic shifts, tillage for agriculture, overgrazing and deforestation for fuel or construction materials. Vegetation plays a major role in determining the biological composition of the soil.

Studies have shown that in many environments, the rate of erosion and run-off decreases exponentially with increased vegetation cover. Unprotected, dry soil surfaces blow away with the wind or are washed off by flash floods, thereby leaving infertile lower soil layers that bake in the sun and become unproductive hardpan, which is an apt environment for desertification.

In fact, according to many scientists, one of the most common causes for desertification is overgrazing or excessive consumption of vegetation by the cattle. The scientific community also concurs with this contention. Interestingly, facts show that there is a natural cause for the existence of desert in the place, which is now the Sahara desert. A natural climate cycle that caused a lack of water in this area from time to time, coupled with overgrazing by the local population, slowly converted the Sahara savanna to the Sahara desert. Precipitation factors were aided by climate change that also caused the acceleration and led to the formation of deserts.

India must recognise the patterns and perceive the threats that dry lands in various parts of the country face. Due to the lack of natural water sources, or drying up of the same, coupled with the problem of overgrazing, Indian lands are faced with the danger of becoming degraded and may eventually be deserted.

The first step to prevent the same will be to ensure that satellite data is employed to create a detailed database that categorises the lands and identifies those that are on the edge of becoming deserts. Emergency measures of replenishing the groundwater table, stopping anthropogenic activities and refreshing the green cover can be immediate solutions. Land is precious and in short supply thanks to population explosion. To lose the little land to deserts would be a true misfortune for India.

Hamas is the bullet, Iran the gun, and China the person who pulled the trigger on the gun to fire the bullet that led to the Israel-Hamas war.

Iran’s partner in the global geopolitical game of survival in an existential crisis of diplomatic isolation, regional tensions, and a fragile economy is China. The Iranian regime views China as a potential ally against the United States, and Beijing views Iran as a potential partner for limiting U.S. influence in the Middle East.

China has remained Iran’s largest trading partner for 10 consecutive years as of 2022, according to the Chinese Ministry of Commerce. China-Iran trade totaled USD 15.8 billion in 2022, up 7 percent year-on-year. In 2021, China agreed to invest between USD 400 to USD 600 billion in Iran over the next 25 years. In the field of transportation alone, China is going to invest USD 12 billion, which includes projects like the high-speed rail link between Tehran and Mashhad, and investment in the Imam Khomeini Airport City. China’s crude oil imports from Iran reportedly set a new record in December 2022.

China’s economic ties to Iran have shielded the Iranian regime from the effects of international sanctions. Over the past several years, China has become Iran’s number one oil customer and trading partner. China has saved roughly USD 4.2 billion by importing a record 1 million bpd from Iran from January 2023 to September 2023, 60 percent above pre-sanction peaks recorded by Chinese customs in 2017 at 623,000 bpd, as Tehran raised output to near-maximum levels and offered discounts as steep as USD 17 a barrel versus Brent.

In March 2023, China brokered an agreement between Iran and Saudi Arabia to restore diplomatic ties seven years after severing relations. The deal reflected Beijing’s growing influence and interest in Iran and in the Middle East.

China has aided Iran’s efforts to modernize its military hardware and doctrine through the transfer of military technology and sales of small arms and tactical ballistic and anti-ship cruise missiles. China has also assisted in the development of Iran’s nuclear program through the transfer of technology and machinery. In August 2023, Iran became the newest member of the SCO, joining China, Russia, India, Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and Tajikistan. This grants Iran a freer hand to openly trade arms with Russia, China, and other SCO countries, which will result in Iran’s expanding its influence and aggression in the region.

Fighting and tension between Israel – Palestine in the West Bank, and Israel – Hamas in Gaza helped advance Iran’s aim of undermining US and Israel ties with Iran’s rivals in the Middle East region – Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, and the United Arab Emirates. With the Abraham Accords, the United States under former US President Donald Trump scored a major diplomatic victory in which Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates agreed to have diplomatic relations with Israel.

Saudi Arabia and Israel were to strengthen their diplomatic relations in keeping with the Abraham Accords but the ongoing Israel-Hamas war has put those plans on ice. China to counter the influence of the United States in the Middle East impressed upon Iran to restore diplomatic relations with Saudi Arabia. China through Iran may have encouraged Hamas to attack Israel.

Hamas gains considerably from Iran’s provision of weapons, technology, training, and financing of terror operations. This support allows Hamas to carry out attacks against Israel. Iran sees Hamas and the Palestine Islamic Jihad, as crucial centers of power in the Palestinian arena and uses these terror organizations to further its agenda against Israel.

Since the Gaza-Israel conflict escalated on October 7, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has repeatedly stated that the question of Palestine needs to be resolved as soon as possible, and the establishment of an independent Palestinian state is the only way to solve the question. Only when the “two-state solution” is fully implemented in the Middle East can real peace be ushered in. In fact, China’s position on the Palestinian concerns has been consistent. China backs the establishment of an independent Palestinian state based on relevant United Nations documents and resolves the Palestinian-Israeli conflict through peaceful negotiations.

China does not directly work with Hamas, but it uses Iran to work with Hamas. Iran provides financial aid, weapons, training, and technological support to Hamas. The Israel-Hamas war will see more of China’s engagement in the Middle East. China is expected to play an enhanced role in efforts to end the war and secure its economic interests and wants to capitalize on the Arab states’ frustration with the U.S. to establish itself as a great power in the region.

Middle-East is crucial to China’s Belt Road Initiative (BRI) for its energy exports and over the years China has been deepening its economic cooperation with Middle-Eastern countries. Chinese investments and construction projects in two of the most prominent Arab nations – Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have totaled USD 97 billion. China has pursued a proactive foreign policy and it is looking at its investments in the railways, roads, seaports, and airports as an extension of its influence in the Middle East.

The Chinese government has always propagated a narrative on the Israel-Palestine conflict that places the blame on Israel. That is because Israel is a close ally of the US and it is the objective of the CCP to undermine the United States government in the international geopolitical community.

The Israel-Hamas war has put on hold the peace talks between Israel and Saudi Arabia. China has ensured through Iran and Hamas that the Middle East region remains in a state of war. For China, the crisis is a chance to establish itself as a kingmaker in the Middle East, win ground from the United State and strengthen partnerships with Russia and across the Arab world. China has got Iran to use its pet Hamas well.

Federal Reserve, Chair Jerome Powell, speaks, speech, Moynihan Lecture,

What Powell has to say at the 2023 Moynihan Lecture in Social Science and Public Policy, Washington, D.C. remains to be heard.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will be speaking today at the 2023 Moynihan Lecture in Social Science and Public Policy, Washington, D.C. On Wednesday, October 25, at 2035 GMT or 4:35 p.m. ET, Fed Chief Jerome Powell gives brief introductory remarks before the 2023 Moynihan Lecture in Social Science and Public Policy event – 2035 GMT.

In four successive presidential administrations—those of John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard M. Nixon, and Gerald R. Ford—Daniel Patrick Moynihan (1927–2003) served as a member. He served four terms in the US Senate beginning in 1976 after serving as both India’s and the UN’s ambassador.


Last week on October 19, 2023, Powell was at the Economic Club of New York, where he discussed recent economic data and the outlook for monetary policy. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that the US central bank is likely to maintain interest rates constant at its next meeting, while leaving the door open for a future raise if policymakers see more signs of sustained economic growth.

The comments virtually confirmed market predictions that the Fed would avoid raising interest rates for the second time in a row when policymakers meet on October 31 and November 1. The Fed chairman also stated that if recent increases in long-term Treasury yields continue, it may reduce the need for more rate hikes.

“Given the uncertainties and risks, and how far we have come, the committee is proceeding carefully,” Powell said Thursday at the Economic Club of New York. “We will make decisions about the extent of additional policy firming and how long policy will remain restrictive based on the totality of the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.”

At the same time, recent economic statistics indicated that US retail sales beat expectations and industrial production increased in September, while nonfarm payroll additions averaged 266,000 over the previous three months, indicating a healthy pace.

Last month, authorities held their policy rate constant in a range of 5.25% to 5.5%, and their predictions showed that 12 of 19 officials forecasted one more raise this year. In his remarks, Powell was careful not to rule out the potential of more tightening. What Powell has to say at the 2023 Moynihan Lecture in Social Science and Public Policy, Washington, D.C. remains to be heard.

CHANGLANG, 24 Oct: In a shocking development, the presence – or rather, the absence – of ghost staffers has surfaced in the education department in Changlang district.

The development comes in the wake of rampant illegal appointments made in the department across the state.

Changlang DC Sunny K Singh issued an order on 20 October, stating that “some ghost staffers have been detected in the education department who are drawing salaries without physical presence.”


Stating that there is a possibility of similar ghost staffers’ ‘presence’ in other departments also, Singh further directed all heads of departments in the district to “verify the status and submit a certificate that all employees of their respective departments exist on the ground.”

The DC had on 19 October issued a notice to the Changlang DDSE, directing the latter to “verify all the regular staffers, including teaching and non-teaching staffers such as LDC, UDC, MTS, etc, through BRCCs and CRCCs, in order to rule out the existence of any ghost staffer enrolled with the education department.”

“It has been brought to the notice of the administration that there appear few regular staffers of the education department whose presence in the district is difficult to establish, yet their salary is drawn every month,” the DC stated.

He further pointed out that “there is a possibility of ghost staffers drawing salaries without their presence, and their antecedents only exist on paper, which, if established to be correct, will be deemed illegal and unlawful.”

It is learnt that the DDSE is yet to respond to the DC’s directive to submit the report.

It is alleged that five staffers under the DDSE have questionable appointment orders. However, their salaries were processed till September this year from Itanagar.

Among the five staffers, it is alleged that one was attached with Deputy Speaker and Changlang MLA Tesam Pongte’s private residence, and another staffer was attached with the DDSE.


Unverified sources claimed that the salaries of the ghost staffers were held back recently, after a minor shuffling among the staffers in the directorate office. The sources further said that the matter came to light after a few questionable staffers started approaching various authorities, seeking remedy and reinstatement of their salaries.

It is reported also that an LDC and a UDC, who never joined duty in Changlang, were allegedly drawing their salaries.

“Their presence in the district could not be established. The salaries of the employees are made based on attendance registers; so there emerges a valid question that, if they were not present, how come their attendance was marked and thus salaries processed month after month?” asked an angry youth on condition of anonymity.

“The disclosure of this new episode has brought to the fore many unanswered questions for the education department to clarify,” he said.

 It is alleged that the ghost staffers were appointed during the then DDSE Ego Doye’s tenure. However, when this daily contacted him, Doye denied the allegation and said that the appointments were made by the directorate and not by him.

When contacted, Education Commissioner Amjad Tak said that the education department is committed to unearth the truth. “If the allegations are true, appropriate action will be immediately initiated, whoever is involved in the scam,” Tak said.


The vigilance department is currently investigating illegal appointment of PRTs, TGTs, UDCs, LDCs and MTS staffers in the education department.

A fire on Patalkot Express in Agra, UP, injures 2 passengers. Cause unknown, affecting train services. By : Sentinel Digital Desk Published :  25 Oct 2023 7:46 PM  | Updated :  25 Oct 2023 7:50 PM UTTAR PRADESH: In a distressing incident on a Wednesday afternoon, a fire broke out in two coaches of the Patalkot Express train, resulting in injuries to at least two passengers.

https://www.sentinelassam.com/national-news/agra-fire-erupts-in-patalkot-express-train-coaches-injuring-passengers-672424","Hamas is the bullet, Iran the gun, and China the person who pulled the trigger on the gun to fire the bullet that led to the Israel-Hamas war.

Iran’s partner in the global geopolitical game of survival in an existential crisis of diplomatic isolation, regional tensions, and a fragile economy is China. The Iranian regime views China as a potential ally against the United States, and Beijing views Iran as a potential partner for limiting U.S. influence in the Middle East.

China has remained Iran’s largest trading partner for 10 consecutive years as of 2022, according to the Chinese Ministry of Commerce. China-Iran trade totaled USD 15.8 billion in 2022, up 7 percent year-on-year. In 2021, China agreed to invest between USD 400 to USD 600 billion in Iran over the next 25 years. In the field of transportation alone, China is going to invest USD 12 billion, which includes projects like the high-speed rail link between Tehran and Mashhad, and investment in the Imam Khomeini Airport City. China’s crude oil imports from Iran reportedly set a new record in December 2022.

China’s economic ties to Iran have shielded the Iranian regime from the effects of international sanctions. Over the past several years, China has become Iran’s number one oil customer and trading partner. China has saved roughly USD 4.2 billion by importing a record 1 million bpd from Iran from January 2023 to September 2023, 60 percent above pre-sanction peaks recorded by Chinese customs in 2017 at 623,000 bpd, as Tehran raised output to near-maximum levels and offered discounts as steep as USD 17 a barrel versus Brent.

In March 2023, China brokered an agreement between Iran and Saudi Arabia to restore diplomatic ties seven years after severing relations. The deal reflected Beijing’s growing influence and interest in Iran and in the Middle East.

China has aided Iran’s efforts to modernize its military hardware and doctrine through the transfer of military technology and sales of small arms and tactical ballistic and anti-ship cruise missiles. China has also assisted in the development of Iran’s nuclear program through the transfer of technology and machinery. In August 2023, Iran became the newest member of the SCO, joining China, Russia, India, Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and Tajikistan. This grants Iran a freer hand to openly trade arms with Russia, China, and other SCO countries, which will result in Iran’s expanding its influence and aggression in the region.

Fighting and tension between Israel – Palestine in the West Bank, and Israel – Hamas in Gaza helped advance Iran’s aim of undermining US and Israel ties with Iran’s rivals in the Middle East region – Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, and the United Arab Emirates. With the Abraham Accords, the United States under former US President Donald Trump scored a major diplomatic victory in which Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates agreed to have diplomatic relations with Israel.

Saudi Arabia and Israel were to strengthen their diplomatic relations in keeping with the Abraham Accords but the ongoing Israel-Hamas war has put those plans on ice. China to counter the influence of the United States in the Middle East impressed upon Iran to restore diplomatic relations with Saudi Arabia. China through Iran may have encouraged Hamas to attack Israel.

Hamas gains considerably from Iran’s provision of weapons, technology, training, and financing of terror operations. This support allows Hamas to carry out attacks against Israel. Iran sees Hamas and the Palestine Islamic Jihad, as crucial centers of power in the Palestinian arena and uses these terror organizations to further its agenda against Israel.

Since the Gaza-Israel conflict escalated on October 7, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has repeatedly stated that the question of Palestine needs to be resolved as soon as possible, and the establishment of an independent Palestinian state is the only way to solve the question. Only when the “two-state solution” is fully implemented in the Middle East can real peace be ushered in. In fact, China’s position on the Palestinian concerns has been consistent. China backs the establishment of an independent Palestinian state based on relevant United Nations documents and resolves the Palestinian-Israeli conflict through peaceful negotiations.

China does not directly work with Hamas, but it uses Iran to work with Hamas. Iran provides financial aid, weapons, training, and technological support to Hamas. The Israel-Hamas war will see more of China’s engagement in the Middle East. China is expected to play an enhanced role in efforts to end the war and secure its economic interests and wants to capitalize on the Arab states’ frustration with the U.S. to establish itself as a great power in the region.

Middle-East is crucial to China’s Belt Road Initiative (BRI) for its energy exports and over the years China has been deepening its economic cooperation with Middle-Eastern countries. Chinese investments and construction projects in two of the most prominent Arab nations – Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have totaled USD 97 billion. China has pursued a proactive foreign policy and it is looking at its investments in the railways, roads, seaports, and airports as an extension of its influence in the Middle East.

The Chinese government has always propagated a narrative on the Israel-Palestine conflict that places the blame on Israel. That is because Israel is a close ally of the US and it is the objective of the CCP to undermine the United States government in the international geopolitical community.

The Israel-Hamas war has put on hold the peace talks between Israel and Saudi Arabia. China has ensured through Iran and Hamas that the Middle East region remains in a state of war. For China, the crisis is a chance to establish itself as a kingmaker in the Middle East, win ground from the United State and strengthen partnerships with Russia and across the Arab world. China has got Iran to use its pet Hamas well.

Listening to Ram talk about how he prepped himself up to play a ���regular-guy-next-door��� in Nenu..Sailaja��� is quite fascinating. Admittedly, director Kishore Tirumala felt the actor was too lean and needed to beef-up to look the part. So the actor decided to put on as much as 10 kilos to look convincing. ���Nenu.. Sailaja��� is a very realistic love story devoid of the usual frills. I play a real guy in the film, the sort that everyone would be able to identify with, someone they know. I���d lost weight to get lean for Pandaga Chesko. Kishore felt my frame was a little too bony to play a regular guy. So, I decided to pile on the pounds and trust me gaining weight isn���t easy,��� shares Ram who is paired opposite Keerthy Suresh in Nenu.. Sailaja..., produced by PV Kishore under Sri Sravanthi Movies.
From selecting the costumes to zeroing in on his hairstyle, extreme care was taken to ensure Ram looked like the guy you���d meet on the street. ���I generally shop abroad for my costumes in the films. But for Nenu.. Sailaja���, the clothes I wear needed to be very commonplace and we sourced them from regular stores. And that���s the reason we kept the look very simple,��� he explains.
In fact, they wanted to make the film so real that they shot only in locations in the country. ���I believed in the director���s vision and he felt there���s no necessity for a foreign locale in a film which is simple and subtle. Well, I think the result is pretty amazing,��� he signs off.
Nenu.. Sailaja... releases today.

Lyricist Na Muthukumar has written 94 songs in 33 films in 2015, and he claims that he has been this prolific for the past 12 years. Revealing how he manages to avoid creative blocks, the National Award-winner says, 'I read a lot, both in Tamil and English. I also watch a lot of world cinema, and travel. If I work continuously for 10 days, I take a break for four days to refresh myself

I spend time with my family, play with my son and that rejuvenates me.'
To ensure that his lines remain fresh and that he does not repeat them, he says he keeps updating himself continuously and tries to stay in touch with the times.
Muthukumar says that he is already part of 120 films in 2016. On how he agrees to a project, he says, 'I don't lay too many conditions while accepting a film. I don't insist that I will take up a project only if I like the story. To me, it is more about doing my job well and writing based on what the situation demands.' While he makes certain demands for big-budget films, for small-budget ones, he says he works within their budget.
His rapport with many filmmakers also results in him taking up so many films, he says. 'I have worked with Hari for 12 films, Vijay for nine films and Lingusamy for eight films continuously. Directors know that I meet their expectations and I remain accessible all the time. So, they insist on having me on board as the lyrics writer,' he says.But at the same time, he does draw a line when it comes to the kind of songs that he will write. 'I have my personal code of ethics. I will not write vulgar lines and avoid taking on such songs,' he assures.

This New Year day, actor-director Mahesh Manjrekar is excited about bringing his latest offering, 'Natsamrat' with Nana Patekar in the lead, to the big screens. It is based on VV Shirwadkar aka Kusumagraj's legendary Marathi play of the same name. Coincidentally, it's Nana's birthday today, and what could be a better gift than this role.
Presented by Zee Studios, the production house behind films like 'Katyar Kaljat Ghusli,' 'Killa, Lai Bhaari,' 'Timepass' and 'Fandry,' 'Natsamrat' traces the rise and fall of a passionate theatre artiste.

I've seen the play at least 45 times. Many artistes, including Dr Shriram Lagoo, have lived this part. You get the stamp of a 'good actor' if you can play this character,' Nana laughs.
No wonder, he was keen to essay the role. Mahesh says, 'I didn't have a script when I approached him. The character is larger than life, and I was convinced Nana would fit the bill.' Nana, who spent six months growing a beard for his character, says, 'We shot the film backwards because of my look.'
Interestingly, this is the first time Mahesh is directing the actor. 'Many people were disappointed that we didn't argue with each other. Both of us like our freedom. So, people were expecting fireworks on the set,' he laughs. Nana concludes with a chuckle, 'Now, we've decided to do another film together so that we can fight.'","

Antony Blinken also said, “we need to substantially and immediately increase the sustainable humanitarian assistance” into Gaza.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said more needs to be done to “protect Palestinian civilians” in Gaza and that, without that, there will be “no partners for peace.”
Speaking to reporters in Tel Aviv on Friday, Mr. Blinken also said, “we need to substantially and immediately increase the sustainable humanitarian assistance” into Gaza.
He also said it was critical to restore the path toward a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict, calling it the only “guarantor” of a safe and democratic Israel and independent Palestine. He said work on that must begin “not tomorrow, not after today, but today.”

Mr. Blinken urged Israel to do everything in its power to protect civilians caught in the fighting in Gaza and ensure they receive humanitarian aid, while underscoring the country’s right to defend itself. Israel, meanwhile, warned that it was on high alert for attacks on its border with Lebanon as fears grew that the conflict could widen.

Israeli troops tightened their encirclement of Gaza City, the focus of their campaign to crush the enclave’s ruling Hamas militants, who launched a brutal attack on Israeli communities that started the war.

But ever since that Oct. 7 assault, there have been concerns the conflict could ignite fighting on other fronts, and Israel and Lebanon’s Hezbollah militant group have repeatedly traded fire along the border. Tensions escalated further ahead of a speech planned for later Friday by Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah.

Hezbollah, an Iran-backed ally of Hamas, attacked Israeli military positions in northern Israel with drones, mortar fire and suicide drones on Thursday. The Israeli military said it retaliated with warplanes and helicopter gunships, and spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said civilians were wounded in the Hezbollah attacks.

“We are in a high state of readiness in the north, in a very high state of alert, to respond to any event today and in coming days,” he said.

Since Israel's war with Hamas began, Hezbollah has taken calculated steps to keep Israel's military busy on the country's border with Lebanon but so far has done nothing to ignite an all-out war.

A war with Hezbollah would be devastating for both Israel and Lebanon. Hezbollah is much stronger than Hamas, with an arsenal of some 150,000 rockets and missiles, some believed to be precision-guided weapons capable of striking deep inside Israel.

Israel has promised to unleash vast destruction in Lebanon if all-out war erupts, accusing Hezbollah of hiding its military installation in the midst of residential areas. The two enemies fought an inconclusive monthlong war in 2006. Renewed fighting could also risk drawing Iran, which backs both Hamas and Hezbollah, into the conflict.

More than 9,200 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza so far, mostly women and minors, and more and than 23,000 people have been wounded, the Gaza Health Ministry said, without providing a breakdown between civilians and fighters.

More than 1,400 people have died on the Israeli side, mainly civilians killed during Hamas’ initial attack, when some 240 people were also taken hostage. Some 5,400 have also been injured.

Twenty-four Israeli soldiers have been killed in Gaza since the start of the ground operation. Since the start of the war, seven Israeli soldiers and a civilian have been killed in different incidents along Israel’s border with Lebanon.

As American officials have before, Blinken pledged unwavering support for Israel and its right to defend itself while on a visit to the country, but he also stressed the importance of protecting civilians amid growing alarm over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.

“We stand strongly for the proposition that Israel has not only the right but the obligation to defend itself, and to make sure that October 7 should never happen again,"" Blinken said. “How Israel does this matters and it is very important that when it comes to the protection of civilians who are caught in the crossfire of Hamas’ making that everything to be done to protect them and to bring assistance to those who so desperately need it.”

This is Blinken's third trip to Israel since the war began and he also plans to visit Amman, Jordan. It follows President Joe Biden's suggestion for a humanitarian “pause” in the fighting. The aim would be to let in aid for Palestinians and let out more Palestinians who hold foreign passports and wounded.

Around 800 people left Gaza over the past two days — the first time people departed the besieged territory other than four hostages released by Hamas and another rescued by Israeli forces.

Blinken first held talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu behind closed doors before starting wider discussions with the leader and his War Cabinet and meeting with President Isaac Herzog.

More than 3,700 Palestinian children have been killed in 25 days of fighting, according to the Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza. Bombardment has driven more than half the territory’s 2.3 million people from their homes. Food, water and fuel are running low under Israel’s siege, and overwhelmed hospitals warn they are on the verge of collapse.

Israel has allowed more than 260 trucks carrying food and medicine into Gaza, but aid workers say it’s not nearly enough. Israeli authorities have refused to allow fuel in, saying Hamas is hoarding fuel for military use and would steal new supplies.

White House national security spokesman John Kirby said the U.S. was not advocating for a general cease-fire but a “temporary, localized” pause.

Israel has not openly responded to Biden’s suggestion. But Netanyahu, who has previously ruled out a cease-fire, said Thursday: “We are advancing. … Nothing will stop us.” He vowed to destroy Hamas rule in the Gaza Strip.

Israel and the U.S. seem to have no clear plan for what would come next if Hamas rule in Gaza is brought down — a key question on Blinken’s agenda during the visit, according to the State Department.

Meanwhile, military officials said Israeli forces have now completely encircled Gaza City, a densely packed cluster of neighborhoods that Israel says is the center of Hamas military infrastructure and includes a vast network of underground tunnels, bunkers and command centers.

Israeli forces are “fighting in a built-up, dense, complex area,"" said the military’s chief of staff, Herzi Halevy.

Hagari, the military spokesperson, said Israeli forces were in “face to face” battles with militants, calling in airstrikes and shelling when needed. He said they were inflicting heavy losses on Hamas fighters and destroying their infrastructure with engineering equipment.

Hamas’ military wing said early Friday that its fighters battled Israeli troops in several areas in Gaza and claimed they killed four soldiers on the northern edge of the city of Beit Lahiya. It also claimed to have destroyed several tanks with locally made anti-tank rockets.

Neither the reports from Israel nor Hamas could be independently verified.

Casualties on both sides were expected to rise as Israeli troops advance toward the dense residential neighborhoods of Gaza City. Israel has warned residents to immediately evacuate the Shati refugee camp, which borders Gaza City’s center.

But hundreds of thousands of Palestinians remain in the path of fighting in northern Gaza, despite Israel’s repeated calls for them to flee. Many have crowded into U.N. facilities, hoping for safety.

Still, four U.N. schools-turned-shelter in northern Gaza and Bureij were hit in recent days, killing 24 people, according to Philippe Lazzarini, general-secretary of the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA.

In the occupied West Bank overnight, Israeli forces killed seven Palestinians in different places and arrested many more, according to the Israeli military and Palestinian health officials.

Pakistan's general elections will be held on February 8, it was announced on Thursday after the election commission officials met President Arif Alvi at the directives of the Supreme Court, ending uncertainty over the much-awaited polls in the cash-strapped country.

The new date was announced by the President House in a statement following a meeting between the top election officials and President Alvi, hours after the election commission lawyer told the apex court that elections would be held on February 11.


On the order of the Supreme Court, Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja along with Attorney General Mansoor Usman Awan and four members of the electoral body met President Alvi to discuss the general elections date, the president's office said.

""The President heard about the progress the ECP has made in delimitation and for elections. After a detailed discussion the meeting unanimously agreed to hold General Elections in the country on 8th February 2024,  it added.

Earlier, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) told the Supreme Court about the February 11 date during a hearing of a set of petitions calling for holding elections within 90 days after the dissolution of the National Assembly and the provincial legislatures.


Last month, the ECP announced that elections would be held in January 2024 but stopped short of announcing a date.

A three-judge bench comprising Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa, Justice Amin-ud-Din Khan and Justice Athar Minallah took up the pleas moved by the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA), Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf and others.

The ECP had announced earlier that 54 days were needed to hold elections after the completion of the delimitation exercise by November 30, and the apex court bench asked the lawyer of the election body to clearly state the stance on the holding of elections in the country.

In response, Sajeel Swati said that the final list of constituencies will be published on December 5 and all other arrangements including the drawing of constituencies will be completed by January 29. ""Hence we decided that elections will be held on Feb 11, which is the second Sunday,"" the lawyer said.


Later, the chief justice in his order stated that the election date given would have to be implemented. ""SC wants polls to be held without any arguments,  the top judge said.

The ECP announcement coincides with the review talks between Pakistan and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for the release of USD 710 million second tranche of a USD 3 billion loan to the cash-strapped country to stabilise its debt-ridden economy.

The clarity on the election date will strengthen the hands of the Ministry of Finance during the negotiations which started on Thursday, although the IMF has not explicitly attached any such condition.

The issue of the election date had been dragging on for weeks after the dissolution of the National Assembly on August 9, as polls should be held within 90 days but the ECP delayed it in order to finalise the electoral districts following the new census held earlier this year.


President Alvi had written a letter to Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja on September 13 in which he proposed that elections be held by November 6.

However, the Ministry of Law and Justice later informed Alvi that the powers to announce the poll date rested with the ECP, not the president.

During the hearing, Justice Minallah asked why it took the president so long to write the letter to the ECP. On the other hand, the chief justice noted that the text of the said letter was vague.

The CJP said that holding elections was good and not a problem.
The ECP's lawyer, while sharing the schedule with the apex court, said that all arrangements including delimitation will be completed by January 29.


Explaining the delimitation process, the lawyer said it would take them 3 to 5 days to issue the final lists. He added that if 54 days are counted from December 5 then we get the January 29 date.

The lawyer said that the ECP was looking to hold the polls on Sunday to make it easier for the people to participate in the elections. He added that under this plan the first Sunday would have fallen on February 4 and the second would be on February 11.

On hearing this, CJP Isa directed the lawyer to ask the chief election commissioner to consult the president and get back to the court.
The decision has garnered mixed reactions from political parties. The JUI-F has opposed the timing of polls due to weather conditions, while the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) party threw weight behind the ECP.


The PPP and PTI, on the other hand, have called for the immediate announcement of the election date and assurance of a level playing field.

The election date is expected to end the uncertainty in the country as political parties will now move into election mode.","U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has emphasized the need to ""protect Palestinian civilians"" in Gaza and called for an immediate increase in sustainable humanitarian assistance to the region. He stressed the importance of restoring the path to a two-state solution for the Israel-Palestine conflict, describing it as the only way to ensure a safe and democratic Israel alongside an independent Palestine. Blinken urged Israel to do everything possible to protect civilians and ensure they receive humanitarian aid while also affirming Israel's right to self-defense. Amid concerns of the conflict widening, Israel remains on high alert for attacks on its border with Lebanon, particularly from Hezbollah, an Iran-backed ally of Hamas. The situation in Gaza remains dire, with thousands of casualties and a growing humanitarian crisis.

Last month, a 21-year-old student, identified as Anil Kumar, died by suicide inside his hostel room at IIT-Delhi. Preliminary investigations into the case revealed the student was pursuing a B.Tech in Mathematics and Computing. He was placed on an extension due to some incomplete subjects and had been staying at the hostel for the past six months.

Though the police did not recover any suicide notes in the student's room, the reason for taking such an extreme step was suspected to be academic stress.

Sixteen per cent did not share an opinion at all.Views of India are most positive in Israel, where 71 per cent say they have a favourable view of the country, the report said.

Pew said the survey was conducted from February 20 to May 22, among 30,861 adults in 24 countries, including 2,611 from India, to examine global views of Prime Minister Modi, the scope of India's global power and Indians' views of other countries.

About eight in 10 Indians report ""favourable"" views of Modi, including a majority (55 per cent) with a ""very favourable"" view, according to the survey result released on Tuesday. This is Modi's second term as Prime Minister and he is also seeking a third term in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. Only a fifth of Indians expressed an unfavourable opinion of Modi in 2023, the Pew survey found.Responding to the results of the Pew survey, the BJP said the popularity of Prime Minister Modi remained intact.

""The popularity of Prime Minister Shri @narendramodi certainly remains intact! Majority of people in India and across the world believe that India's global influence is getting stronger!"" the official handle of BJP said in a post on platform X, formerly Twitter.

It added that the Pew survey ""stands as a testament to the above statements.""

""Indian adults are more likely to believe India's power is on the rise. Around seven in ten Indians believe their country has recently become more influential. This stands in comparison with a 2022 survey conducted across 19 countries, where a median of only 28 per cent said the same,  Pew said.


According to the report, about half of Indians (49 per cent) say that the influence of the US is getting stronger in recent years, and 41 per cent say the same about Russia. Meanwhile, Indians' views on China's influence are somewhat more mixed, it said.

Indian athletes did very well at the recently concluded Asian Games held in Hangzhou, China, and their feat of garnering over 100 medals for the first time in Asia’s premier track and field competition has been justly celebrated across the country.ndian athletes did very well at the recently concluded Asian Games held in Hangzhou, China, and their feat of garnering over 100 medals for the first time in Asia’s premier track and field competition has been justly celebrated across the country.

Indeed, India’s tally of 107 medals 28 gold, 38 silver and 41 bronze was its best ever Asian Games performance. But the country’s aspiration to become a top sporting nation, at least in Asia, is still some way off; there are miles to go for that to come to fruition. Taking the 1982 Asiad hosted in New Delhi as the baseline, for example, tells us that as a proportion of the total medals competed for, the Indian haul in 2023 107 out of 1500 was inferior to our 1982 performance when we won 57 out of a total 679 medals at stake.

Further, the gap between the leading Asian sporting nation, China, and India, is widening.
In 1982, China won 153 medals to India’s 57 (2.7 times more), and in 2023 the PRC won 383 medals to India’s 107 (3.6 times more). The point being made is that as we celebrate the impressive medals tally in the latest iteration of the Asian Games, it is also a moment for some introspection. India’s massive youth population which is projected to reach 365 million by 2030 needs to start training now if we want to make even a small impression on the world and Olympic stage.Way back in 2007, there was an attempt to introduce a sports policy which never materialised. The implementation of the National Sports Development Code (2011), while a good initiative, has been patchily and the results have therefore been suboptimal though it helped societal internalisation of the fact that sports apart from cricket are not merely pastime but can be a means to drive social development, foster inclusion, and create well paid jobs. The current dispensation has, in this context, shown its commitment to putting money where its mouth is the current fiscal year has the highest ever budget for sports in India’s history and the Centre’s Khelo India and ‘TOPS’ (Target Olympic Podium Scheme) programmes have had a role to play in India’s performance at Hangzhou.

Khelo India has made a difference at the grass-roots with 1,000 budding athletes joining it annually. They receive Rs 6.28 lakh each year to cover expenses from training to pocket money. Many of them move up to the advanced training programme as part of the TOPS developmental group. TOPS also supports elite athletes (core group) with funds, gear, exposure to global sporting competitions, the best coaching, and a monthly allowance of Rs 50,000. Athletes in the developmental group get Rs 25,000 per month.

At Hangzhou, 125 Khelo India athletes participated and 36 of them won medals. Now, the welcome integration of sports into the National Education Policy 2020 must be followed by an emphasis on sports in the National Curriculum Framework for School Education 2023 if India wants to truly change the way citizens at large perceive sports.

NEW DELHI: 'Bharat' seems to be on the fast-track. A railway ministry proposal to the Union Cabinet, the government's highest decision making body, dropped ""India"" replacing it with ""Bharat""- the nomenclature for the country favoured by the Modi administration - in its entire content.
This is perhaps the first proposal for the Cabinet that has used 'Bharat' in place of India in every aspect whether the logistics cost, modal share of cargo and country's economy.
Sources said the usage of 'Bharat' is going to be more in government documents in the coming days. They added that 'India' and 'Bharat' have been used interchangeably in the Constitution and there is nothing wrong in using this inCabinet proposals.
The issue of using ""Bharat"" in place of India garnered attention after an invitation for a G20 dinner sent out by President Droupadi Murmu in her capacity as ""President of Bharat"" instead of ""President of India"". Even at the G20 Leaders' Summit, the country's name was displayed as ""Bharat"" on the name card in front of PM Narendra Modi when he addressed the meeting.
In recent weeks, official releases have been increasingly using 'Bharat' in place of 'India'.

Under the rules of Lok Sabha, especially on page 246 of the Kaul-Shakdher book, the witness is protected from court proceedings and their hue and cry... Answers are needed on the question of (hampering) national security and corruption; here we are prepared for the fight,"" Dubey posted on X in Hindi. Earlier in the day, Moitra wrote to the Ethics Committee chairman seeking to postpone her appearance before the panel for examination after November 5 stating that she has prior commitments in her constituency as Durga Puja celebrations continue in West Bengal.

Meanwhile, the TMC MP also sought to cross-question Darshan Hiranandani, who has been at the centre of the 'cash for questions' allegation and has turned approver in the case.In one of the paragraphs of Moitra's letter to Sonkar, Dubey's name was misspelt as 'Dubai'.

""The Committee against the order of natural justice, if I may humbly add summoned and heard the complainants Dubai and Dehadrai on October 26, 2023, before allowing me, the alleged accused, a chance to be heard,"" Moitra wrote.

He further said that the accused MP was so intoxicated by Dubai that even his name had been changed to Dubai in the letter written to the Chairman of the Ethics Committee.

MUMBAI: A four-year-old video shared by BJP on social media of deputy chief minister Devendra Fadnavis saying he will return to helm the state has rocked the political and bureaucratic circles.

""I will return for building a new Maharashtra,"" the state BJP posted on Friday on X, along with the video. The post was deleted a few hours later after BJP leadership took objection over the content on the grounds that such a post would create instability in the three-party Mahayuti government, which is already on a shaky wicket owing to intra-alliance disputes.

The video has been posted at a juncture when state assembly speaker Rahul Narwekar is hearing a petition by Shiv Sena (UBT) MLA Sunil Prabhu against CM Eknath Shinde and a section of Shiv Sena legislators.
Defending the content of the Fadnavis video, state BJP spokesperson Keshav Upadhye said it is part of the Mahajanadesh Yatra and in the past too, it has been circulated on umpteen occasions. The video gives new energy to the younger generation of the party, he added.

RAIPUR: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Saturday promised free education in government schools and colleges in Chhattisgarh and Rs 4,000 a year for 'tendu' leaves collectors if his party retains power in the state. Addressing an election rally in the Bhanupratappur assembly constituency in Kanker district, Gandhi asked if Prime Minister Narendra Modi brings up 'OBC' (other backward class) in his speeches, then why he is scared of a caste census.
Caste census will be conducted in the country if the Congress is voted to power, he said.
Bhanupratappur is among the 20 constituencies that will see polling on November 7 in the first phase of the Chhattisgarh elections. The second phase will be held on November 17.
""We are going to take a major step for you which we call 'KG to PG'. From KG (kindergarten) to PG (post-graduation), free education will be provided in government institutions to students (if Congress retains power in state). They will not have to pay a single penny,"" Gandhi said.

Gandhi promised that if the Congress forms the government in the state after polls, then tendu leaves collectors will be given Rs 4,000 per year under the Rajiv Gandhi Protsahan Yojana. This is being seen as a major announcement from the Bhanupratappur seat, which is a part of the tribal-dominated Bastar region.
Pitching for a caste census, he said, ""Narendra Modi ji uses 'OBC' word in his every speech but why he is scared of the caste census...OBCs have to become aware as they are being ditched.""

Gandhi also announced that the Congress would conduct a caste census in the country if it is voted to power in Delhi (at the Centre). ""We have already made this promise for Chhattisgarh,"" he said.


The Congress MP targeted the BJP-led Centre and claimed that it works for the benefit of two-three industrialists. The Congress works in the interest of farmers, Dalits, labourers and Adivasis, he said.

Key promises made by the Congress ahead of the last assembly polls have been fulfilled in Chhattisgarh, he claimed.


Objecting to the use of 'vanvasi' in place of 'Adivasi' for tribals, he said its use by the BJP is an insult to Adivasis and an attack on their culture, history and language.


During his speech, Gandhi stopped briefly and walked to the other corner of the stage carrying a bottle of water apparently after someone fainted on the ground. Gandhi returned to the dais and asked if the person was alright.

BHOPAL: A Madhya Pradesh Congress delegation has submitted a complaint letter to the state election commission against Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and Prime Minister Narendra Modi for delivering a political speech at a government program in Chitrakoot.
Chairman of state Congress unit media department, KK Mishra has alleged that CM Chouhan is a candidate from Budhni assembly constituency in Sehore district for the forthcoming state assembly polls and gave a political speech at a government program in Chitrakoot.
""CM Chouhan is a candidate from Budhni for upcoming state assembly elections and despite being a candidate, he participated in the government program in Chitrakoot. Chouhan also gave a political speech in the program and it was a violation of the model code of conduct,"" Mishra said.
He further said that a case should be registered against PM Modi and CM Chouhan for violating the model code of conduct.


Meanwhile, the congress leader further said, ""The second issue is that the staff officers who are out of their constituency due to election duty should be given ballot papers which are not being given as of now. They should not be deprived of voting rights.""

Mishra also said they had full faith that the State Election Commission would investigate both the cases impartially and would take appropriate action.


Madhya Pradesh is one of the five states set to hold elections this year. The state is scheduled to undergo polls on November 17 and the counting of votes will take place on December 3.

Gene therapy is a cutting-edge medical field that holds the promise of treating genetic disorders by altering the very building blocks of life: DNA. In this explainer, we'll delve into the fascinating world of gene therapy, uncovering how it works and the potential it holds for transforming medicine.
Understanding Gene Therapy

At its core, gene therapy is a medical approach that involves modifying or manipulating a person's genes to treat or prevent disease. It's a groundbreaking departure from traditional treatments that often focus on managing symptoms rather than addressing the root cause.

The Role of DNA
DNA, the famous double helix, is the genetic blueprint that contains the instructions for building and operating every part of your body. In gene therapy, scientists and medical professionals target specific genes within your DNA to correct or replace faulty genetic instructions.

Types of Gene Therapy
Gene therapy comes in various forms, but two primary approaches dominate the field:

Somatic Gene Therapy: This approach targets non-reproductive cells in the body (most cells). It aims to treat diseases in the individual patient and is not passed on to future generations.
Germline Gene Therapy: This technique focuses on altering genes in reproductive cells (sperm or egg cells) and is intended to be inherited by offspring. It's a much more complex and controversial area due to ethical and safety concerns.
The Process of Gene Therapy

Gene therapy typically follows these general steps:
Identification: Scientists identify the specific gene responsible for a genetic disorder.
Correction: Using various methods, they introduce a healthy copy of the gene or repair the faulty one.
Delivery: The corrected gene is delivered into the patient's body, often using modified viruses as carriers or other delivery methods.
Integration: The corrected gene integrates into the patient's DNA and starts producing the missing or functioning protein.
Monitoring: Continuous monitoring helps assess the therapy's effectiveness and safety.
Applications of Gene Therapy

Gene therapy has shown promise in treating a wide range of genetic disorders, including:

Cystic Fibrosis
Hemophilia
Muscular Dystrophy
Sickle Cell Anemia
Certain Types of Cancer
Blindness caused by genetic mutations

Challenges and Ethical Considerations

While gene therapy offers immense potential, it also raises significant challenges. These include concerns about safety, off-target effects, and the long-term consequences of genetic modifications. Ethical questions about germline gene editing, accessibility, and affordability are also hotly debated.

The Future of Gene Therapy

As technology advances and our understanding of genetics deepens, the future of gene therapy holds promise for even more transformative treatments. It's an exciting frontier where science fiction becomes science fact, offering hope to patients and their families affected by genetic disorders.


Conclusion: A Revolution in Medicine

Gene therapy represents a remarkable advancement in medical science, where the manipulation of DNA can potentially cure diseases once thought incurable. While challenges and ethical considerations remain, the potential to improve lives and change the course of medicine is undeniable.

Gene therapy exemplifies the power of human innovation and determination to conquer the most complex challenges in the pursuit of a healthier, disease-free future.

RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das further said:

Even as headline inflation experienced considerable volatility, a silver lining has been the declining core inflation, supported by declining cost push pressures and ongoing transmission of past monetary policy actions.
To sum up, domestic economic growth is maintaining the momentum. Our fundamental goal is to align inflation with the 4.0 per cent target and anchor inflation expectations. Recurring incidences of large and overlapping supply side shocks bring with them the risks of generalisation of inflation impulses, possible loss of monetary policy credibility and de-anchoring of inflation expectations.

The moderation in inflation in September would also be aided by the sharp reduction in household LPG prices in end-August. The projections suggest that throughout much of Q3:2023-24, food inflation pressures may not see a sustained easing, but ample buffer stocks of food grains, softening edible oil prices, and government’s proactive supply side interventions are expected to keep check on unusual price spikes of key food items, RBI governor Das said.

In a brutal terror attack, Hamas killed 1400, kidnapped 203, and injured 3800 innocent Israeli people. Israel has responded by declaring war on Hamas.

There have been varied opinions from global leaders to the determined stand taken by the Israeli government and the unleashing of its brute force to put an end to the terrorism of Hamas on its people. Pope Francis told the gathering at St Peter’s Square on Wednesday, “The victims are increasing and the situation in Gaza is desperate. May, please everything, everything be done to avoid a humanitarian disaster, and it’s possible that this war might grow. War does not solve any problems. It only sows death and destruction. It increases hatred and multiplies revenge. War destroys the future.”

Pope Francis has called for an end to Israel-Palestinian violence and has made public his views on war not being able to solve any problems only sowing seeds of death, hatred, revenge, and destruction. But, interestingly, the Catholic Church has been a strong advocate of a ‘Just War’.

In the words of St Augustine of Hippo – a bishop, philosopher, and theologian of the Catholic Church: The only just reason to go to war was the desire for peace. We do not seek peace in order to be at war, but we go to war so that we may have peace. Be peaceful, therefore, in warring, so that you may vanquish those whom you war against, and bring them to the prosperity of peace.

Furthermore in his book – City of God, St Augustine expressed, “A state has higher authority in their view, and if the response to evil and aggression met specific criteria, it would be deemed just, and the individual could participate. True religion looks upon as peaceful those wars that are waged not for motives of aggrandizement, or cruelty, but with the object of securing peace, punishing those who do evil, and of supporting the good.”

The ‘Just War’ theory of the Catholic Church attempts to reconcile three things: One, taking human life is seriously wrong. Two, states have a duty to defend their citizens and defend justice. And three, protecting innocent human life and defending important moral values sometimes requires the willingness to use force and violence. The principles of the justice of war are commonly held to be: having just cause, being a last resort, being declared by a proper authority, possessing the right intention, having a reasonable chance of success, and the end being proportional to the means used.

The Catholic Church recognizes that a nation has not just the right, but the obligation to ensure the security of its citizens and to respond to aggression, even – if only under very strict conditions – by means of military force.

In July 2022, Pope Francis during a 90-minute interview with Telam, the news agency of the Argentine state, answered a question about lack of dialogue being an aggravating factor for a world that he believes is currently living a piecemeal Third World War stated: I believe it is time to rethink the concept of a ‘just war’. A war may be just; there is the right to defend oneself. But we need to rethink the way that concept is used nowadays. I have said that the use and possession of nuclear weapons are immoral. Resolving conflicts through war is saying no to verbal reasoning, to being constructive. But interestingly in March 2022, Pope Francis opined that there is no such thing as a just war; when he spoke about the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia.

Israel is not attacking Palestine. Israel is at war with Hamas. Hamas is a terror organization. A war against a terror organization, however, is not the same as a war about territory. It is a new kind of war. It is a war against an enemy who does not represent a nation or a people in the traditional sense but represents an ideology of terror.

A war against terrorism is a war to re-establish, in a world torn by fear and strife, respect for the dignity of persons and their rights; it is a war that wants not simply to block an enemy, but to foster an equitable coexistence and order in the relationships between persons, peoples, and cultures. That is exactly what Israel wants for its people. In a war against terror, winning the war means winning the peace. And peace can only be restored when terrorism is put to an end. Therefore, the only end game for Israel is to end the terror, and to end the terror is to end Hamas. For Palestinians too, the end of Hamas will sound the bugle of a new dawn of peace between Israel and Palestine in the months ahead.

Political leaders questioning the principles of Israel’s actions against Hamas must first understand that Israel is not fighting Palestine and it is not in a war against a nation, neither does it seek to occupy Gaza. Israel is fighting a war against terror and Hamas is the terrorist. Israel is protecting the basic human rights of its citizens, rights that Hamas violated on October 7th, 2023. Nations, including the Arab Nations must willingly or grudgingly accept the simple truth that Israel has waged a ‘Just War’ against Hamas.

Trinamool has not issued any official statement on Mahua Moitra row. Congress leader Adhir Chowdhury said the issue to him is like a mountain out of molehill.","The ‘Just War’ theory of the Catholic Church attempts to reconcile three things: One, taking human life is seriously wrong. Two, states have a duty to defend their citizens and defend justice. And three, protecting innocent human life and defending important moral values sometimes requires the willingness to use force and violence. The principles of the justice of war are commonly held to be: having just cause, being a last resort, being declared by a proper authority, possessing the right intention, having a reasonable chance of success, and the end being proportional to the means used.

The Catholic Church recognizes that a nation has not just the right, but the obligation to ensure the security of its citizens and to respond to aggression, even – if only under very strict conditions – by means of military force.

In July 2022, Pope Francis during a 90-minute interview with Telam, the news agency of the Argentine state, answered a question about lack of dialogue being an aggravating factor for a world that he believes is currently living a piecemeal Third World War stated: I believe it is time to rethink the concept of a ‘just war’. A war may be just; there is the right to defend oneself. But we need to rethink the way that concept is used nowadays. I have said that the use and possession of nuclear weapons are immoral. Resolving conflicts through war is saying no to verbal reasoning, to being constructive. But interestingly in March 2022, Pope Francis opined that there is no such thing as a just war; when he spoke about the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia.

Israel is not attacking Palestine. Israel is at war with Hamas. Hamas is a terror organization. A war against a terror organization, however, is not the same as a war about territory. It is a new kind of war. It is a war against an enemy who does not represent a nation or a people in the traditional sense but represents an ideology of terror.",4,Politics,2023-10-20,"The Israeli military announced plans to evacuate the northern city of Kiryat Shmona on Friday, after days of clashes with Hezbollah fighters along the border with Lebanon.

CHANGLANG, 24 Oct: In a shocking development, the presence – or rather, the absence – of ghost staffers has surfaced in the education department in Changlang district.

The development comes in the wake of rampant illegal appointments made in the department across the state.

Changlang DC Sunny K Singh issued an order on 20 October, stating that “some ghost staffers have been detected in the education department who are drawing salaries without physical presence.”


Stating that there is a possibility of similar ghost staffers’ ‘presence’ in other departments also, Singh further directed all heads of departments in the district to “verify the status and submit a certificate that all employees of their respective departments exist on the ground.”

The DC had on 19 October issued a notice to the Changlang DDSE, directing the latter to “verify all the regular staffers, including teaching and non-teaching staffers such as LDC, UDC, MTS, etc, through BRCCs and CRCCs, in order to rule out the existence of any ghost staffer enrolled with the education department.”

“It has been brought to the notice of the administration that there appear few regular staffers of the education department whose presence in the district is difficult to establish, yet their salary is drawn every month,” the DC stated.

He further pointed out that “there is a possibility of ghost staffers drawing salaries without their presence, and their antecedents only exist on paper, which, if established to be correct, will be deemed illegal and unlawful.”

It is learnt that the DDSE is yet to respond to the DC’s directive to submit the report.

It is alleged that five staffers under the DDSE have questionable appointment orders. However, their salaries were processed till September this year from Itanagar.

Among the five staffers, it is alleged that one was attached with Deputy Speaker and Changlang MLA Tesam Pongte’s private residence, and another staffer was attached with the DDSE.


Unverified sources claimed that the salaries of the ghost staffers were held back recently, after a minor shuffling among the staffers in the directorate office. The sources further said that the matter came to light after a few questionable staffers started approaching various authorities, seeking remedy and reinstatement of their salaries.

It is reported also that an LDC and a UDC, who never joined duty in Changlang, were allegedly drawing their salaries.

“Their presence in the district could not be established. The salaries of the employees are made based on attendance registers; so there emerges a valid question that, if they were not present, how come their attendance was marked and thus salaries processed month after month?” asked an angry youth on condition of anonymity.

“The disclosure of this new episode has brought to the fore many unanswered questions for the education department to clarify,” he said.

 It is alleged that the ghost staffers were appointed during the then DDSE Ego Doye’s tenure. However, when this daily contacted him, Doye denied the allegation and said that the appointments were made by the directorate and not by him.

When contacted, Education Commissioner Amjad Tak said that the education department is committed to unearth the truth. “If the allegations are true, appropriate action will be immediately initiated, whoever is involved in the scam,” Tak said.

The share price of Jubilant Foodworks, which operates Domino’s restaurants in India tanked 6.39% to Rs 495.25, a day after the company posted second-quarter profit at Rs 97.20 crore, down 26.1% in comparison to Rs 131.53 crore during the second quarter of FY23. It posted revenue from operations at Rs 1,368.63 crore, up 5.2% as against Rs 1,301.49 crore during the corresponding quarter of last year.stock price fell 4% in the last five days and 7.44% in the last one month, while it gained 13.71% in the last six months and marginally 0.05% year to date We are downgrading Jubilant FoodWorks (JFL) to ‘Hold’ as the recent run-up does not dovetail with its performance. In fact, we are adjusting down FY24E/25E EBITDA by 5%/5%, factoring in the performance despite building in a robust LFL showing in Q3FY24 (7%). Longer term, JFL is targeting LFL of 5–6%. We ascribe the stock a PE of 50x, similar to its five-year pre-covid average (FY15–19 average SSSG/revenue CAGR of 6%/15% versus FY24–26E’s 4%/11%), and value Popeyes’ separately. This yields a Target Price of Rs 541 (Rs 549 earlier).”Macro, as well as the base, is yet to turn favourable for Jubilant Foodworks, evident from another miss in 2Q. SSG declined an est. 5%; dine-in faced severe pressure while delivery grew at overall level. Management continues to take self-help measures (new org structure, tech investments, store re-imaging, 20-min delivery etc.) and hopes for a 2H recovery. Even while Jubilant Foodworks is a structural play, we stay on sideline given uncertainty on SSG recovery & therefore, earnings. ‘Hold’.”Jubilant Foodworks in its rejuvenated approach to drive growth through portfolio expansion in Domino’s and chicken QSR segment (Popeyes), coupled with enhanced consumer experience in value segment and by reimaging store could achieve mid-single digit LFL growth. Though weak demand, incremental competition in pizza QSR, and rising inflation pose short-term challenges, we expect JUBI to defend its current margin. We cut FY24E/ FY25E earning by 6.5%/3.0% and introduce FY26E estimates and retain ‘Buy’ with a revised DCF-based Target Price of Rs 625 (implying EV/EBITDA of 20.0x avg. FY25E/FY26E).

Axis Bank’s share price surged 1.52% to Rs 970, a day after the Bank posted a 10% growth in net profit at Rs 5,863 crore for the second quarter of FY24 as compared to Rs 5,329 crore in Q2FY23. The total income of the Bank in the second quarter of FY24 surged to Rs 31,660 crore compared to Rs 24, 094 crore in q2FY23.  Axis Bank’s stock price fell 1.97% in the last five days and 4.55% in the last one month, while it has gained 9.11% in the last six months and 5.82% in the last one year.We tweak estimates and see 16% Cagr in profits (normalised) over FY23-26. The bank has also accreted capital of 54bps during 1H to 15% CET-1 CAR. We feel the bank can also anchor the 18% ROE quite well, that should allow for decent compounding. At 1.5x FY25 adj. PB and 9x adj. PE, valuations are attractive and around 25% discount to ICICI Bank. Axis is among our top picks in the sector with Target Price of Rs 1,250 (Rs 1,200 earlier) based on 1.9x Sep-25 adjusted PB. ‘Buy’ call stays.”

We remain watchful of deposit accretion for the bank as it will be critical to sustain healthy loan growth (targets 400-600bp higher growth vs. system over the medium term). Asset quality remains robust, with slippages declining further and recoveries remaining strong. We change our earnings estimates by -1.7%/2.1% for FY24/FY25 and expect FY25 RoA/RoE of 1.9%/16.6%. We retain our ‘Buy’ rating with a Target Price of Rs 1,150 (1.7x FY25E ABV)“In our view, Axis Bank continues to be in investment mode w.r.t to its distribution and liability franchise as well as digital initiatives. While initial signs of success are visible, we believe it will take some time for the bank in closing the gap with larger private sector peers. In our view, NIMs sustainability coupled with steady loan growth will lead to meaningful valuation upsides for Axis Bank. Given the long-term measures undertaken to improve the liability franchise and portfolio granularity, we expect ROA/ ROE of 1.7%/ 17.6% in FY25E. We maintain ‘Buy’ with a Target Price of Rs 1,040 valuing the core bank at 1.8x FY25E P/BV.”We prefer to remain skeptical of Axis Bank’s growth, margin and asset quality trajectory in the near term. We have valued the standalone bank at 1.8x FY25F BV and added Rs 50/share for subsidiaries. Accordingly, we have arrived at a revised target price of Rs 1,050 (Rs 1,030 earlier) and maintained our ‘Hold’ rating on the stock. Better-than-expected growth/margins pose an upside risk while lower profits are a downside risk.

The Dearness Allowance (DA) for government employees including teachers, pensioners and family pensioners would be increased from 34 per cent to 38 per cent with immediate effect, Chief Minister M K Stalin said here on Sunday. The increase, effective January 1, 2023, would benefit about 16 lakh staff and the decision was taken after considering the representation of government employees, he said. Though the move would entail an additional annual expenditure of Rs 2,359 crore, the government has taken up the financial burden considering the welfare of state employees. On the protest of government teachers seeking 'equal pay for equal work', he said a committee of three top officials, headed by Finance Secretary-Expenditure, would be set up. The government has decided to take steps based on the recommendations of the panel, he said. Terming the DA hike a 'New Year gift,' he appealed to the staff to cooperate with the government in its efforts aimed at people's welfare and prosperity.

The Tripura government has signed an agreement with Asian Development Bank (ADB) amounting to Rs 2,275 crore to strengthen and improve power distribution efficiency in the northeastern state, Deputy Chief Minister Jishnu Dev Varma said on Saturday.
Terming the agreement as “historic” for the state, Dev Varma said it is the single biggest project in any plan through an externally aided project. “The project agreement was signed by Power Secretary, Govt of Tripura, Brijesh Pandey and Nilaya Mitesh, the officer in charge of ADB’s Indian Resident Mission, New Delhi, remotely on Friday after extensive deliberation and evolution”, Dev Varma said at a press conference here.
The deputy chief minister said the ADB project will support the state government’s efforts to strengthen its power sector by replacing inefficient power plants and strengthening the distribution system. Of the Rs 2,275 crore fund, the central government will repay Rs 1,820 crore while the state is supposed to provide Rs 455 crore, he said, adding the project will be implemented in the next three years.
Heaping praise on Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman for clearing the first externally aided project for the power sector in the state, Dev Varma said the state government will undertake massive renovation of two power projects – Rukhia in Sepahijala district and Gumati Hydro project in Gomati district. Besides, there will be a lot of work in the transmission sector to improve the existing system.
At present, gas based Rukhia power project produces 66 MW power and its installed capacity will be doubled by modernizing the plant, he said, adding the Dumbur hydro power project’s capacity will be increased from 5 MW to 10 MW. The externally aided project will benefit five to six lakh consumers and it will also generate 6,000 to 6,500 direct jobs in different levels.
Asserting that Rs 3,000 crore will be invested in the northeastern state’s power sector, the DyCM said the government aims to provide quality power supply to the consumers. However, no new power plant is proposed in the ADB project. (PTI)
Currently, the northeastern state generates 84 MW power out of the state’s per day demand of 450/460 MW. It receives around 500 MW power from OTPC, NEEPCO and other central PSUs. The states export 160 MW power to Bangladesh.
Apart from the ADB funding, an additional amount of Rs 800 crore will be spent to improve the power distribution which includes underground transmission line in Agartala city and installation of smart electric meters.","The District Development Committee (DDC) has issued directives to expedite the restoration of roads that were dug up by the Kerala Water Authority (KWA).

BJP is understood to have conveyed to Speaker Meira Kumar on Sunday that its Deputy Leader in Lok Sabha Gopinath Munde will be the candidate for the post of Chairperson of Parliament’s Public Accounts Committee.

Sources said BJP’s decision to appoint Mr. Munde as PAC Chairman and senior leader Yashwant Sinha as head of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on External Affairs was conveyed to the Speaker.

The post of PAC Chairperson, which goes to the main opposition, fell vacant after expelled BJP leader Jaswant Singh resigned from the post.

Mr. Munde, who was recently appointed Deputy Leader after the elevation of Sushma Swaraj as Leader of Opposition, will continue to head the PAC till March 31 as the chairperson is chosen for a period of one year.

He, however, is likely to get elected as chairperson again when it comes up for renewal.

Traditionally, BJP has given the post of PAC Chairman to the Deputy Leader but had made an exception in 2009 to placate Jaswant Singh, who reportedly wanted a room and staff in Parliament.

He had earlier enjoyed these privileges as Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha till he was elected from Darjeeling in the last Lok Sabha elections.

Mr. Sinha, who is also a member of the PAC and was considered the front-runner for heading it, will be the new Chairperson of the Standing Committee on External Affairs, another post vacated by Ms. Swaraj.

The BJP has completed the election of presidents of 11 of its 14 district units in Kerala by consensus. The choice of presidents for Thiruvananthapuram, Thrissur and Kottayam units were postponed. These may now take place only after the election of State president later this week.

No consensus could be arrived at regarding the election of the Thiruvananthapuram unit, as two groups are strongly opposed to each other regarding the choice of president. In Thrissur, there are complaints about the election process and hence it was deferred. In Kottayam, the party is hoping to settle differences over the choice of president shortly through discussions.

Elected representatives from the districts would be meeting in Kozhikode on January 5 and 6 to elect the new State president. The Central leadership has appointed H. Ananda Kumar as the returning officer for the election.

Criticism of the draft Direct Taxes Code has already started pouring in as though it is a Bill which is awaiting to be passed by Parliament. It has to be remembered that it is only a discussion paper, as has been described by the Government, so that one need not take it as the official view of the government, especially since it has been prepared by the tax administration without any involvement of either trade and industry, profession or even the field officers. In personal taxation, there are welcome proposals by way of revision of slabs and reduction in rate of tax. But there has been a major change proposed as regards the method of giving incentives on savings.

More normal recessions can be countered by conventional monetary and fiscal measures. According to the IMF, the crisis has left deep scars which will affect both supply and demand for many years to come. On the supply side, in many advanced countries, the financial system has become dysfunctional and will take some time to go back to its previous state.

NEW DELHI: A hike in passenger train fares, particularly in suburban service, and increase in the minimum distance to be covered in passenger and express trains are among the recommendations made by an official committee in its report submitted to Railways. The D K Mittal Committee, formed on December 4 this year to suggest ways and means to raise the revenue of Indian Railways, has made out a strong case for increasing the highly subsidised and loss-making suburban train fares. According to the recommendation, the suburban fares need to be increased by 2 paise per km every two months till they reach a break-even point.However, it did not specify the quantum of hike needed to be made in long-distance mail/express train services. The committee yesterday submitted its report to Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu. The committee also said the minimum distance of travel in passenger train should be increased from existing 10km to 20km and in mail/express segment it should be increased from 50km to 100km. Currently, even if a passenger travels less than 10 km he is charged for the 10km in a passenger train and 50km in mail/express trains. The expert panel has observed that the current suburban fares is 60 per cent less than road travel cost and emphasised the need for increasing fares in a gradual manner. The committee has also suggested that railway PSUs should be given the task to execute the rail projects. ""The PSUs should be given a free hand to raise funds from the banks and after completion of the projects, they would be handed over to railways,"" said a senior Railway Ministry official who was privy to the report. The committee's report is crucial for railways as its recommendations is expected to help the ailing national transporter to take certain concrete measures which would be presented to Parliament in the rail budget for 2015-16 in February. Railway Ministry had set up the nine-member committee on December 4 under the chairmanship of former Secretary (financial services) D K Mittal to examine the existing revenue structure and recommend ways to raise fund for the public sector behemoth facing cash crunch. The committee, in its report, has given a detailed study on the efficacy and sufficiency of the existing revenue structure and avenues for raising income besides identifying its leakages. On expenditure front, the committee has suggested certain measures for reduction in spending.

NEW DELHI: The gift that consumers were expecting from fuel retailers isn’t coming on the New Year day. State-run oil marketing companies have decided against cutting petrol and diesel prices. Instead, the companies would absorb the benefits of falling crude oil prices to meet their inventory losses. The industry was expecting fuel companies to reduce petrol and diesel prices by at least Rs 2 per litre because of the steep fall in international oil rates. On Wednesday, crude fell below $56 a barrel, and was inching towards a record six-year low. “Late in the evening, we have been asked to go home as there would not be any price cut tonight,” a Mumbai-based executive working for Indian Oil Corp said requesting anonymity. Earlier, companies had directed key executives to wait after office hours pending a decision on the price cut.Companies have some additional revenue gains, but they want to make up for their inventory losses, oil ministry officials said. “Petrol and diesel are deregulated fuels and companies are free to set their prices,” one official said. The government lifted pricing control on petrol four years ago. Diesel was deregulated on October 18 this year.

NEW DELHI: The government is considering giving a one-time option to private power companies to shift to regulated electricity tariff from tariff discovered through competitive bidding. The power ministry has agreed to look into a long-pending demand from private power developers that will help about Rs 4 lakh crore stressed plants recover adequate tariffs and cover costs. The ministry has appointed a committee consisting of electricity regulators to conduct a comparative study between competitive tariff and regulatory tariff. A senior power ministry official said the proposal is being considered based on demand from power companies and suggestion from a working group constituted by the finance ministry to resolve financing issues to power plants.The committee under the chairmanship of IIFCL chairman Santosh Nayar suggested offering one-time shift of stressed assets from competitive bidding regime to regulated tariff regime. The power ministry official said such shift in tariff derivation has also been seconded by the advisory committee led by railway minister Suresh Prabhu that said the bid documents should provide for absorption of costs that arise due to issues outside the control of developers. Power plant developers have been demanding a one-time window for migration to regulatory tariffs after they faced issues like high imported coal costs due to changes in Indonesian laws, steep rupee depreciation, nonavailability of coal and gas, high inflation and interest rates or lack of power purchase contracts. While the regulated tariffs are governed by section 62 of the Electricity Act, section 63 covers the competitive tariffs discovered through by state distribution companies. About 80% of the installed 1,53,000-mw coal-based power generation capacity is operating under section 62 under which the tariffs are determined by regulatory commission. Section 63 does not provide for revision in tariffs for factors beyond the control of the developers. Association of Power Producers director general Ashok Khurana said tariff determination through section 62 provides flexibility for adjustment of uncontrollable factors unlike price discovery under section 63 which is very rigid and expects the bidder to predict 25 years price movement of uncontrollable factors – fuel, foreign exchange and interest rates. “The outcome of the rigid process is evident as more than 90% of the plants which have tariff discovered under section 63 have requested for tariff revision on grounds of uncontrollable factors. The answer lies in a one-time dispensation allowing for redetermination of tariffs for the affected projects so that these projects don’t get mothballed. For the future projects, a mix of tariff discovered under section 63 (competition on the basis of fixed cost during construction stage) and tariff determined under section 62 (for the operational life of the plant) will derive the best advantage for consumers,” Khurana said.Khurana claimed that the proposed shift will lead to about 50% lesser power tariffs compared to recently discovered tariff through bidding of .`5 – 6 per unit. Meanwhile, the ministry has decided to cancel the bidding for two ultra mega power projects after all private companies withdrew their bids protesting new bidding framework.","The government is considering allowing private power companies to switch from competitive tariff bidding to regulated electricity pricing, addressing the demands of power developers with stressed plants. A committee of electricity regulators will study the comparative advantages of both systems, with the potential shift being prompted by issues like high coal costs and factors beyond the developers' control, providing flexibility for tariff adjustment. This change could result in significantly lower power tariffs compared to recent competitive bidding prices. Additionally, the government has canceled bidding for two ultra mega power projects due to private companies' objections to the new bidding framework.",3,Industry,2015-01-01,"The D K Mittal Committee, formed on December 4 this year to suggest ways and means to raise the revenue of Indian Railways, has made out a strong case for increasing the highly subsidised and loss-making suburban train fares.

They come from the City of Destiny! Chess sisters Sahithi Varshini and Falguni embarked on a journey dotted with innumerable challenges and sacrifices by their parents to chase bigger dreams in the world of chess.

In a way, the saga of Sahithi (ELO 2181) and Falguni, who is one step away from being a qualified FIDE arbiter, has never been easy both on the 64 squares and away from it.

So much so that struggling father Lokesh of HPCL had to go on loss of pay and spend more than a year in Budapest (Hungary) to ensure that the passion of his daughters towards the sport never dwindled.

“I took a personal loan of ₹14 lakh to counter the challenges and also a year’s long leave (loss of pay) to support Sahithi’s dream of being there right on top,” says Lokesh.

“This also meant staying in Europe to ensure my daughter got the desired training and exposure by way of participating in as many tournaments as possible,” he said.

“We rented an apartment in Budapest to be the base to travel around Europe as shuttling between India and Europe would have been more expensive,” Mr. Lokesh said.

“Even while 16-year-old Sahithi, now a Class X student, is trying to keep improving her game and her ELO rating, my elder daughter, 20-year-old Falguni who holds the senior national arbiter title, has officiated in major GM tournaments in Budapest and even got selection in a college there,” he said.

“I am confident that all my efforts would prove to be worthy of taking the risk as Sahithi has already achieved the WIM and the FIDE Master titles and reached the top 10 in the women’s section from India last year,” the proud father said.

“The high point of Sahithi is to make it to the Chess Olympiad in Chennai last year and winning the Reti Farkas Blitz Championship in Budapest, outwitting three GMs on the way,” Mr. Lokesh said.

“One can understand the agony of my daughters given the fact that their mother Jaya Sri fell ill and Sahithi contracted COVID-19 in Abu Dhabi and was quarantined. So, it has been a struggle all the way with little support from anyone outside the family,” he said.

“With Sahithi inching closer to becoming a WGM and Falguni close to achieving the title of FIDE Arbiter, we are desperately looking for financial support,” Mr. Lokesh signed off with optimism.

Baku: In an anticlimax of sorts, the second game of the Chess World Cup final between Indian teen sensation R Praggnanandhaa and Magnus Carlsen failed to throw a winner, as it ended in a draw after 30 moves here on Wednesday. The two players settled for a quiet draw in the second classical game after one-and-a-half hours of play.

The champion will be decided via two tie-breaks on Thursday.


Five-time world champion Carlsen played a solid game with white pieces against Praggnanandhaa. The Indian did not face any trouble with black pieces, with the players agreeing to a draw after 30 moves in an equal Bishop ending.

Praggnanandhaa was ahead on time at the start of the contest, but was unable to press home the advantage. He himself came under time by the end of the contest.

The first game on Tuesday had ended in a stalemate after over four hours of play and 70-plus moves, following which Carlsen said he was a bit under the weather.

Speaking after the game, Praggnanandhaa said, ""I didn't really think that he would go for a quick draw today, but I realised when he went for this line that he wanted to make a draw; I was also fine with that.


""I also feel exhausted, as I said in the previous interviews. Now I can just give everything tomorrow and relax after that."" To a question if he realised that Carlsen was under the weather during the first game, the Indian player said, ""Yeah. I did feel that he did not have a lot of energy. I hope he recovers tomorrow.""

Asked if he would suggest to the organisers of the World Cup in future for an extra rest day before the final, he said, ""Yeah, if it is there. It would be good.""

About the media attention he was getting, the Indian star said, ""I am definitely getting used to this. It is good to see so many people following chess. Chess is definitely getting popular, that way I am very happy.""


The 18-year-old Praggnanandhaa has been enjoying an incredible run in the tournament, having already beaten world No.2 Hikaru Nakamura and world No.3 Fabiano Caruana to set up a final date against the Norwegian Grandmaster.

The results in the ongoing tournament also helped Praggnanandhaa qualify for Candidates 2024 tournament, which will be held in Canada.

Praggnanandhaa, thus, became the third youngest player after the legendary Bobby Fischer and Carlsen to qualify for the Candidates tournament.

After the game, Carlsen said, ""Praggnanandhaa has already played a lot of tie-breaks against very strong players... I know he is very strong. If I have some energy, if I have a good day, obviously I will have good chances."" ""I am very grateful to the organisers, FIDE and the doctors and nurses, who got me some good treatment. Today, I am feeling a bit better but I still didn't feel like I had the energy for a full fight, so I thought, let's get one more day of rest.

""Hopefully, I will have more strength tomorrow,"" the Norwegian world No.1 added.

The two tie-break games in rapid format will be played with a time control of 25 minutes for each player plus 10 seconds increment per move, starting from move 1.

If those two games also fail to throw a winner, two more games with time control of 5 minutes for each player will be played. There will be 3 seconds increment per move, starting from move 1.


Praggnanandhaa is only the second Indian after the legendary Viswanathan Anand to reach the World Cup final.

Posting on social media platform X (formerly Twitter) during the game, former world champion Anand wrote, ""Wow, did not expect this opening! Is Magnus repeating his game 12 strategy of 2016 and aiming for a tiebreak?""

""If so, Magnus has spent the day thinking of the tiebreak whilst Prag can only start to do so after the game.""","A second game between Rameshbabu Praggnanandhaa and Magnus Carlsen in a World Cup final ended in a draw. This is a significant chess event, as Magnus Carlsen, the reigning World Chess Champion and one of the world's top chess players, faced off against the young and talented Indian chess prodigy, Praggnanandhaa Rameshbabu.

A draw in chess often indicates that neither player was able to secure a decisive victory in the game, leading to a tie. In high-stakes competitions like the World Cup final, draws can be particularly intense as players strive to gain an advantage in subsequent games.

The fact that Praggnanandhaa, a rising star in the chess world, was able to hold his own against Carlsen, who is widely considered one of the greatest chess players in history, is a notable accomplishment. It demonstrates the young player's exceptional skill and potential.

To follow the latest developments and outcomes of this World Cup final match between Praggnanandhaa and Carlsen, it's recommended to consult official chess news sources and updates from the tournament organizers.",3,Sports,2023-08-24,"In an anticlimax of sorts, the second game of the Chess World Cup final between Indian teen sensation R Praggnanandhaa and Magnus Carlsen failed to throw a winner, as it ended in a draw after 30 moves here on Wednesday.

LinkedIn is cutting its workforce short once again.
Story Highlights
LinkedIn has laid off over 600 employees in the fresh round of job cuts.
In May earlier this year, the job cuts affected over 700 employees.
Microsoft-backed LinkedIn did not detail the reasons for the layoffs.
Microsoft-owned LinkedIn, a job search-focused social media platform, on Monday announced that it will cut about 668 jobs across the company’s engineering, product, talent and finance teams. The layoff represents about 3 percent of the total workforce and comes for the second time this year. The company has not given the reasons for the layoff, but said it will continue “to invest in strategic priorities.” LinkedIn previously reported it had 19,500 employees across 36 offices globally, but there is no update on how many are left after the job cuts.

Many had condemned the looting of arms and ammunition from police armouries in the early days of the unrest which began on May 3, 2023. We shall not go into the matter of where exactly did the looting of guns started as it happened in both hills and the valley, although some vested interests are trying to spread the message that it happened in the valley only.


Yes, one cannot agree more with the fact that the number of arms looted in the valley are huge in figures. Yet, it would be more prudent to start with a question as to how well armed are the civilian population in the state. In the valley, it is mostly VVIPs and neo-rich who are licence holders of arms while in the hills even the common folk own licence guns for purposes of hunting or otherwise. And of course, there is the factor of unaccounted guns including the country-made variety which one has seen in recent times.


So, when the present unrest and attacks from the surrounding hills started there were only a few licensed guns in the peripheral villages which was a pittance as compared to the licensed guns in the hills and the sophisticated variety which was supposed to be in the Malkhanas of designated SoO camps.


And the need to arm themselves and protect their villages practically forced them in the direction of police armouries. The question of justification aside, that is exactly how it happened. And that is why, the womenfolk in the valley protested the arrest of village volunteers and combing operations aimed at gathering the looted weapons. Their basic argument is that, if at all there has to be operations it should be both in the hills and the valley and again the sporadic attacks and frequent clashes should be put to a stop before such operations.

The story so far: An earthquake of magnitude 6.3 struck Western Afghanistan on October 15, barely a few days after multiple earthquakes of similar strength killed at least a thousand people in the Herat province. Multiple earthquakes have destroyed entire villages in the country. Afghanistan’s Taliban-run government has put out conflicting numbers on the death toll from the October 11 quake, news agency Reuters reported. On Friday, the disaster management ministry revised downwards the death toll from multiple earthquakes to around 1,000 from an earlier figure of over 2,400. The U.N.’s humanitarian office had said on Tuesday that around 1,300 people had died, the report added.","On the other hand, a general notification issued through the District Magistrates of various districts has asked the holders of arms licenses issued by the magistrate to submit the arms licenses along with the registered arms by March 1 to the respective police stations as mentioned in the arms license.


Failing to comply with the notification will result in the cancellation of the license without further notice, it had added. Now, district authorities need to come up with reports on this. It might be said now that, the general situation is slowly inching towards normalcy with occasional incidents. There is also a need to address the issue of armed gunmen looting houses and creating panic among the general population.


The other day, some gunmen fired at an unsuspecting crowd injuring five innocents. Before that, a house in Imphal East was robbed of jewellery and cash and a hand grenade was left at the residence of a member of Youth of Manipur. There might be numerous unreported incidents involving guns also as there are still so many guns at large.",4,International News,2023-10-17,"LinkedIn laid off over 600 employees, continuing the trend of job cuts in 2023.

Here is a 24-year-old educated woman, pursuing a degree in homeopathy, who says she has embraced Islam and married a Muslim man of her own free will. Set this against a Kerala High Court ruling annulling her marriage on the plea that she could have been brainwashed and coerced into marriage as part of organised radicalisation by Islamic fundamentalists in parts of that State.

Reacting to the petition of her father Asokan and basing its order after detailed investigations, the High Court had handed over Hadiya’s guardianship to her parents, who kept her home for almost 11 months and discontinued her studies to be a homoeopath at a college in Salem. They restricted her movement, fearing she would drift further from her roots, and claimed were protecting her against murder threats by radicals, who feared she would spill the beans on their recruitment methodology. The apex court appropriately prioritised individual freedom of an adult by separating the particularities of whether all of her choices were born of her free will indeed, or were they imposed given her supposed “conversion” or indeed if she had the ecosystem to decide for herself, free of pressure, manipulation and insinuation.

The judges, after interacting with her for half-an hour, granted her the freedom to study at her homoeopathic college in Salem and concentrate on her educational and economic rehabilitation, and therefore, boost her sense of self-worth that has so far been defined alternatively by her parents and husband. If the Court released her from the control of her parents and let her exist as a free individual and get a grip on things that have been a part of her normal rhythms, it also didn't send her back to her husband as a corollary. In fact, the court entrusted her guardianship to the dean of the homoeopathic college in Salem, though she preferred otherwise. And though Hadiya wanted her husband to bear the expenses, the court ensured that the Salem college allowed her internship, participation in classes and accommodation. It even directed the Kerala police to take care of her safety and directed the college to treat Hadiya like any other normal student.

By providing Hadiya a neutral space for her personal efflorescence, it restored her dignity as a woman, who should be making choices independent of referencing herself in the context of either her father or husband. Justice DY Chandrachud clarified that Hadiya’s actions should be independent of any patriarchal yoke. “Wife is not a chattel and husband cannot be a guardian. She has her own identity in life and society. Even I am not a guardian of my wife. Please make her understand,” he told lawyers appearing for her ‘husband’. By allowing Hadiya a neutral space till her case on the annulment of her marriage by Kerala High Court is heard again in January, the judges have allowed her thinking time to sort out her priorities even as it looks into the NIA report of her alleged “forced” conversion.

Many may argue that individual liberty and autonomy, right or wrong, of an adult should be respected. Sure. But it needs to be made absolutely certain whether it's a “coached” opinion or one made under duress. The Court has allowed Hadiya that space to disentangle her own neutrality from the insidious trap of either parental or spousal coercion. In this respect, it has, in fact, gone ahead of the Kerala High Court ruling, which referred to her as a “girl” instead of a “woman” and seemed to infantalise her as a vulnerable waif who needed male approbation and protection to carry on her life. By letting her meet friends and reclaim her adulthood, the court has allowed her to negotiate her life on her own terms, whatever that might be in the end. She did express her wish to complete her studies, a personal goal at this point. If a month later, she is determined to stake her identity on love, the Court would at least defend itself against charges of bias and giving Hadiya room to exercise her personal freedom. As the judicial system is under attack for dehumanising her, the Supreme Court had no option but to not let Hadiya appear like a prey for all kinds of activism to feed on.

The Court has to take a very decided and educated call in the conspiracy angle of the Hadiya case as it is a part of a series of petitions by parents alleging the possibility of certain radical organisations inducing conversions among impressionable young people and encouraging “love jihad” operations. One misstep and the after-effects could be devastating in terms of the spill-over effect on other cases of a similar nature.The Court has instructed NIA, which had filed a detailed report on the basis of Kerala police and its own investigations, to further probe whether Hadiya was indeed                           co-opted into Islam through a systematic, long-drawn and organised process. It must be remembered that the NIA examined the case of Athira Nambiar, who was ultimately returned to her family.

Hadiya’s case is a tad more complex. She apparently first became friends with a young Muslim woman as part of a social organisation, which has links with the radical People's Front of India (PFI), which in turn is alleged to have association with the dreaded Islamic State. She apparently converted after her new-found friendship and chose her life partner Shafin over the internet, who also wassuspected to be a radical given his conversations in a social media chat group which had some hardliners as members. Subsequently, those members, according to Shafin, were barred. No solid case of conspiracy against his alleged designs to convert or induct people in Syria has yet been made out.

Question is whether Akhila, as Hadiya was known before her conversion, displayed a behaviour consistent with her present line of thoughtIJ Is her transformation in faith a matter of personal conviction and enlightenment or by constant persuasionIJ Is she being made a trophy of honour by extremist groups on both sides of the religious spectrumIJ  There are layers of complexity, some of which pertain to national security. And that needs patient dissection and analysis before the court can give its ultimate verdict.

The Madhya Pradesh government today told the State Assembly that a cell headed by a senior police officer is being constituted to monitor the activities of the non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) in the state.

Home Minister Bhupendra Singh made the announcement during a discussion on an adjournment motion about the chit fund companies or NBFCs brought by BJP MlA Yashpal Singh.

Informing that 4,500 such companies have been prevented from working in the state, the home minister announced that a cell, to be headed by Additional Director General of Police (ADGP)-level officer at the police headquarters, is being formed to monitor the NBFCs operating in the state.

Yashpal Singh, who raised the issue of alleged cheating by the NBFCs, said as many as 19 agents hired by such companies committed suicides in Neemuch and Mandsaur districts.

He alleged that the operators of these companies fled after collecting thousands of crores of rupees from people by employing local youths as agents. ""Now, these agents are facing criminal cases, while the directors of such companies are roaming scot free,"" he said.

The minister, while claiming that no agent has committed suicide, said several such NBFCs have duped the people across the districts.

Some moments in cricket history seems frozen in the annals of time and MS Dhoni‘s 2011 World Cup final match winning six against Sri Lanka at Wankhede is one of them. Now, the Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) announced that they will be putting the two seats where the ball had landed, on auction.

‘Dhoni finishes off in style… To eternalize the glory of this moment, the two seats where the ball landed at the Wankhede Stadium after MS Dhoni struck the ICC World Cup 2011 winning six will be auctioned by the MCA,” the MCA tweeted on Thursday.

In the match, after Sri Lanka posted a total of 274 for 6 in the allotted 50 overs, India were placed 114 for 3 when Dhoni joined Gautam Gambhir in the tense chase. The skipper played an unbeaten knock of 91 runs to guide India home, which included that iconic six. Dhoni was first involved in a 109-run partnership with Gambhir for the fourth wicket before stitching an unbeaten fifth wicket partnership of 54 runs with Yuvraj Singh.

Earlier this year, Dhoni had also talked about the six-hitting moment saying, “To me, it was not the winning moment, it was 15-20 minutes ago when emotionally I was very high. And at the same time, I wanted to get done with it. We knew that we would win this from here, and it was very difficult for us to lose. So yes, you know it was more of a sense of satisfaction, job done, let’s move on from here.”

It was India’s first World Cup win in 28 years after the 1983 triumph and Dhoni had also shared an emotionally high moment from the tense final.

“The best feeling was 15-20 minutes (before the winning moment). We didn’t need a lot of runs, the partnership was well-placed, there was a lot of dew. And the stadium started to sing Vande Mataram. That atmosphere I feel is very difficult to recreate – maybe in this [upcoming 2023] World Cup, there is a similar scenario, once the stadium, the fans start contributing. You know, it’s a very difficult (atmosphere) one to replicate. But it can only be replicated if the occasion is similar to that (in 2011) and there are like 40, 50 or 60,000 people who are singing,” he had said earlier this year.","The Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) is auctioning the two seats where MS Dhoni hit the ICC World Cup 2011 winning six against Sri Lanka at Wankhede Stadium.

In a deft move, the Trinamool Congress today urged the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Congress to withdraw their respective candidates for the post of Deputy Speaker and pressed for postponement of the August 4 election with a view to evolving a consensus on the issue.

Addressing newspersons, the Trinamool leader, Ms Mamata Banerjee, said she has conveyed her views on the Deputy Speaker’s issue both to the Prime Minister, Mr Atal Behari Vajpayee, and the Congress leaders, Mr P.A. Sangma and Mr Santosh Mohan Deb. The Lok Sabha should not be divided on the issue, she said. ""I have told both the parties to work for a consensus"", she said.

According to the schedule of the Deputy Speaker’s election, the nominations have to be filed tomorrow. The election, if needed, has to take place on August 4.

While the Congress has nominated the veteran parliamentarian, Mr P.M. Sayeed,who has also been promised support by the Left parties, and the Janata Dal and other Opposition parties, the ruling BJP combine has fielded three time Lok Sabha MP from Dhanbad in Bihar, Mrs Rita Verma for the post.

""If the Congress withdraws its candidate, then I will convince the Prime Minister. He is sensible. He is not rigid"", Ms Banerjee said.

Claiming that her party has the support of five North-east MPs on the issue, the Trinamool leader said: ""We do not want the government to be toppled or the House divided at this juncture.""

Ms Banerjee said ""we (MPs from North-east) held a meeting on Friday and will be meeting again shortly to take a collective decision on Deputy Speaker"".

The change in her stand, comes a day before the ruling coalition MPs are to meet under the chairmanship of Mr Vajpayee to finalise their stand on the issue.

To a question whether she would support any candidate nominated by the Prime Minister, Ms Banerjee said ""we will decide that at our meeting tomorrow... We will attend tomorrow’s BJP and its allies meeting convened by Mr Vajpayee and press for consensus"".

""Our options are open till tomorrow and not the day after"", she said adding that the Congress and the BJP ""should not be rigid"".

However, she maintained that there was no danger to the government. ""We do not want this government to fall. Our commitment is to this government and there is no question of withdrawing support. There is no connection between the Deputy Speaker’s election and the (stability of) the government"", Ms Banerjee asserted.

To a question whether the Trinamool Congress would join the government, she said ""we have not taken a decision on the issue as yet"".

However, sources close to Ms Banerjee said there was a direct co-relationship between her demand for postponement of Deputy Speaker’s election and her party joining the government. She has successfully managed to rope in five MPs from the North-east for striking a bargain, sources said adding that she was now claiming support of 12 MPs.

Ms Banerjee has been trying to bargain for posts of two cabinet minister and one minister of state for her party. At the same time, she would like to give an impression that her party was not opposed to the candidature of the Congress nominee, Mr P.M. Sayeed.

It was a bargain, rather a very tough bargain in the disguise of nice principles, a senior Samata Party leader said. Everything would be settled tomorrow, he said.

On the deportation of the illegal Bangladeshi migrants from Mumbai, Ms Banerjee said atrocities have been committed against them. ""There may be Bangladeshis there. But they should not be ill treated"", she said adding that there were some Indians too who were harassed.

She said the Maharashtra government has promised to stop deportation for three months. The government would thus get time to finalise its strategy on the deportation issue,she pointed out.

The Congress Working Committee (CWC) today ""accepted"" the Jain Commission’s final report but rejected the government’s decision to constitute a multi-disciplinary monitoring agency (MDMA) even as the party gave indications of continuing with its hardline against the DMK.

The party did not agree with the action taken report (ATR) as such as parts were ""politically motivated,"" senior Congress leader Arjun Singh told reporters.

""There is no contradiction between the interim report and the final report. Have a look at the report"", he said in reply to questions on the final report, virtually saying nothing on the role of the DMK and its Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi on whom the interim report had come down heavily.

To another question, he said the party did not regret its decision to pull down the United Front government on the issue of dropping the DMK ministers in the wake of interim report late last year.

In reply to a query whether the party repented the line taken last year on the interim report, he replied in the negative saying that ""there is no change in the Congress perception"".

He said the party’s stand in details would be elaborated in Parliament when the discussion on the report takes place.

The government has decided to set up the MDMA in the CBI to further investigate the role of controversial 'godman' Chandraswamy, Janata Party MP Subramanian Swamy and all other accused in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case, and on how to proceed on the commission’s recommendations to interrogate Mr Karunanidhi.

Sidestepping questions whether the Congress, like the AIADMK, would demand dismissal of the DMK government, he said there was ""a slight delicacy"" involved in putting forth the party’s point of view.

Asked whether the Congress would approach the DMK for its support to party candidate P.M. Sayeed for the Lok Sabha Deputy Speakership, he said ""if somebody wants to support our candidate, he is welcome.""

Asked whether the Congress repented its earlier decision to withdraw support to the United Front government based on the interim report of the Jain Commission, he said there were no regrets.

We had only asked the Gujral government to drop the three DMK ministers till the DMK was cleared of the charges. When Mr Gujral was not ready even to talk to us, we had decided to withdraw support to his government, the Congress leader remarked.

The CWC regretted the BJP's failure to honour the convention to have the Deputy Speaker from the largest opposition party and said the ruling party went back on its initial commitment.

The CWC accepted the recommendations of the Karunakaran committee on constitutional affairs to extend the term of all committees and office-bearers of the Congress party from two to three years.

The party deplored the steps being taken to dilute the rights provided to the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe employees by the Congress governments. The committee requested the party chief to set up a small committee to go into the details of the matter and submit a report to her at the earliest.

Ms Gandhi, in her opening remarks, thanked the Congress workers for their massive presence in the Capital on July 28 to participate in the agitational programme. She said these agitational programmes of the party would continue.

BJP general secretary Venkaiah Naidu today justified Union Government’s decision to order a probe by a multi-disciplinary monitoring agency on the Jain Commission’s report on former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi’s assassination and said there was no need for the DMK to overreact on the action taken report (ATR).
Mr Naidu told reporters there was no need for the DMK to overreact on the ATR and also on the government’s decision to refer such issues when the commission wanted further probe by multi-disciplinary monitoring agency.

""Observations by the Jain Commission with regard to DMK leader and Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu M. Karunanidhi is serious and it deserves to be looked into"", he said, adding that the commission in page 361, volume five, had said Mr Karunanidhi was not interrogated on certain issues, which were relevant.

The general secretary said since the government had not come to any conclusion, ""Then why should the DMK overreact and make charges against the government. Truth should be made known to the public"".

Mr Naidu said, ""The government will not work under pressure from any quarters. It is interested to bring out the realities before the people. Besides, 26 conspirators involved in the assassination, some more persons might be involved"".

Mr Naidu said: ""In 1994 senior Congress leader Arjun Singh had objected when the Congress party, which was in power at that time wanted to wind it up demanding further probe raising many issues"".

""The BJP has not appointed the Jain Commission nor has it made any changes. There is uneasiness among Congress leaders as Chandraswami was very close to certain leaders"", Mr Naidu said.

The general secretary said the BJP wanted further discussion on the report and on the Verma Commission report as there were some serious observations made in it.","Trinamool Congress urged BJP and Congress to withdraw Deputy Speaker candidates for consensus, proposing election postponement. Leader Mamata Banerjee reached out to PM Vajpayee and Congress leaders Sangma and Deb. Five North-east MPs backed Trinamool's stance. Banerjee aimed to prevent a divided House, ensuring government stability. Trinamool kept doors open for joining government, aiming for key ministerial posts. The move intertwined the Deputy Speaker election delay with Trinamool's government inclusion, leveraging support from North-east MPs.

After talking late into the night, bleary-eyed Afghans rose before dawn today for a seventh day of negotiating a post-Taliban government, their efforts clouded by fresh remarks from Kabul.

The four Afghan factions represented at the UN-sponsored talks in a top-security hotel outside Bonn have generally agreed the outline of an interim government but still face the most difficult task of choosing 29 persons for a new cabinet.

The UN had initially set a goal of last Saturday to reach an accord, but officials now say the slow-moving talks could continue through this week.

Reshaping the government could sideline Northern Alliance leader Burhanuddin Rabbani, who is still recognised by the UN, but his grumbling in Kabul threatens the deal.

In an interview with The Washington Post published today, Mr Rabbani proposed a new plan to keep him and his coalition in power for up to six more months, comments at odds with his delegation. He also ruled out any special role for former King Zahir Shah in the future of Afghanistan.

“My name would be for the leadership council,” Mr Rabbani said.

An adviser to the group backing former King Zahir Shah said they would propose the former monarch’s close aide Abdul Sattar Sirat to head the interim administration. An adviser to the dominant Northern Alliance said his group had backed the choice.

KABUL: Mr Burhanuddin Rabbani has decided to accept any one of four possible nominees to lead an interim Afghan administration, his spokesman said today.

“Mr Rabbani approved the UN proposal and authorised his delegation in Bonn to choose one of the below-mentioned candidates as the head of the interim administration,” his spokesman Sayed Najibullah Hashimi told Reuters on telephone. Reuters

They said tribal forces killed 11 foreign Taliban fighters and overran a building that appeared to have been used as an office by members of suspected terrorist mastermind Osama bin Laden’s Al-Qaida network.

Gul Lali, a key lieutenant to top opposition commander Gul Agha, said the dead foreigners belonged to the Al-Qaida, blamed for carrying out the September 11 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington.

“These were 11 of Bin Laden’s men, from Egypt, Libya and Saudi Arabia. Nineteen more were injured. We have now captured half of the airport,” he said. AFP

Israeli helicopters today destroyed Yasser Arafat’s presidential residence and offices in a missile strike in Gaza City, while the Palestinian leader was out of Gaza, an AFP correspondent on the scene said.

The helicopters also fired around 10 missiles at Mr Arafat’s heliport in here and destroyed two helicopters and damaged the third one. Mr Arafat is left without a single working helicopter, Palestinian security officials said.

The strike came just hours after hawkish Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon rushed home to weigh a response to a spate of Palestinian suicide bombings launched against his country while he was in Washington.

“The Gaza attack is a clear message we are sending to Mr Yasser Arafat that the games are over and we hold him responsible for the recent attacks,” a senior army officer said on Israeli Radio.

Israeli tanks and armoured vehicles have descended en masse on Palestinian areas in the West Bank, the Palestinian Authority said in a statement today, without giving further detail.

WASHINGTON: The White House on Monday said “Israel has a right to defend itself,” as Israeli helicopters pounded Palestinian sites after a string of weekend suicide bombings that killed more than 20 Israelis.

Asked whether US President George W. Bush was sympathetic to the Israeli decision to retaliate, Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer told reporters: “Obviously, Israel has a right to defend itself, and the President understands that clearly.”

The White House said Israel and Yasser Arafat must continue to pursue dialogue while emphasising that the Palestinian leader must show “in deeds” that he wants peace.

DUBAI: The Palestinian Authority has called on the USA to intervene following Israel’s raids on the Gaza Strip, chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat told Abu Dhabi television on Monday.

“I spoke to the Americans minutes after the raids started. They said they would do their best (to stop them), but didn’t say more,” Mr Erakat said.

Washington: President Trump announced on Friday that the summit meeting he had cancelled with North Korea's leader would be held after all, the latest twist in a nuclear-edged diplomatic drama that has captivated and confused much of the world. The President rescheduled the get-together with Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, barely a week after scrubbing it on the grounds that Kim's government had shown ""open hostility"" to wards his administration. In the days since, both sides worked to bridge the divide and proceed with the meeting.
The reversal followed an Oval Office meeting on Friday afternoon with a high-ranking North Korean envoy who de livered a personal letter from Kim to Trump. The envoy, Kim Yong-chol, the former North Korean intelligence chief and top nuclear arms negotiator , became the first North Korean official to set foot in the White House since 2000 and only the second ever to meet with a sitting Ameri can President. The on-again, off-again summit scheduling had all the earmarks of a television cliffhanger from a President who made a name for himself House hosting a reality show on NBC first for 14 years, only this time with deadly serious concentrative quinces. The session is again scheduled for June 12 in Singa- day pore. Trump, who has sought to first impose ""maximum pressure"" on North Korea through eco nomic sanctions, has insisted that it give up its arsenal of nu- the clear weapons, but Kim has II, the sent conflicting signals about his willingness to consider that. Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush each negotiated with North Korea to bring an end to its nuclear weapons programme, only to have the deals ultimately fall apart. Neither one, however, ever agreed to meet with the North Korean leader, raising the stakes for Trump as he tries to achieve what they could not. Clinton did host a North Korean official at the White in October 2000, the time a sitting American President had met a represent to the Pyongyang government. Much like his latter- counterpart would 18 years later, Jo Myong Rok, vice-chairman of North Korea's National Defence Commission, delivered to Clinton a personal letter from country's leader, Kim Jong father of Kim Jong-un

Donald Trump has suggested his summit with Kim Jong-un could still go on as planned, marking yet another dramatic reversal for the US president who just a day earlier canceled the meeting in a letter to the North Korean leader.
“We’ll see what happens,” Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday, adding that his administration was in talks with Pyongyang and the summit was still possible on its originally scheduled date of 12 June.
“They very much want to do it. We’d like to do it,” he added.
Asked if North Korea was playing games, Trump responded, “Everybody plays games.”
Trump tweeted later on Friday that the US was having “very productive talks” with Pyongyang about the possible summit.
The president’s comments came after North Korea said it was still willing to engage in direct talks, calling the planned summit between Trump and Kim “desperately necessary”.
“We express our willingness to sit down face-to-face with the US and resolve issues anytime and in any format,” North Korea’s vice foreign minister Kim Kye-gwan said in a statement. “Our commitment to doing our best for the sake of peace and stability for the world and the Korean Peninsula remains unchanged, and we are open-minded in giving time and opportunity to the US.”
Earlier on Friday, Trump welcomed the statement as “warm and productive”.
“We will soon see where it will lead, hopefully to long and enduring prosperity and peace,” he tweeted.
Very good news to receive the warm and productive statement from North Korea. We will soon see where it will lead, hopefully to long and enduring prosperity and peace. Only time (and talent) will tell!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 25, 2018
North Korea’s response moved to place the blame for the failed meeting on the US. It has consistently worked to portray itself as the driver of progress in a relationship that has remained hostile for over six decades. Kim Jong-un has been crafting an image of a responsible statesman against an erratic Trump.

Washington: President Donald Trump pivoted from his abrupt cancellation of a planned summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, saying it may still happen on the originally scheduled 12 June date.
Trump told reporters on his way to board the presidential helicopter that US officials are in talks with North Korea after the country’s “very nice statement"" on Friday.
""We are talking to them now,"" Trump said on Friday, adding that the summit with Kim may proceed and “it could even be the 12th.""
“We would like to do it,"" Trump said of the summit, and “they very much would like to do it.""
North Korea’s first vice foreign minister Kim Kye Gwan said on Friday that his country still wanted to pursue peace and said it would give Washington more time to reconsider talks. He added that North Korea “inwardly highly appreciated"" Trump for agreeing to the summit, and hoped the “Trump formula"" would help lead to a deal between the adversaries.
“The first meeting would not solve all, but solving even one at a time in a phased way would make the relations get better rather than making them get worse,"" Kim said in a statement carried on Friday by the state-run Korean Central News Agency. “We would like to make known to the US side once again that we have the intent to sit with the US side to solve problem regardless of ways at any time.""
The statement from Pyongyang appeared designed to get the summit back on track after Trump cancelled their planned Singapore meeting, citing “tremendous anger and open hostility"" in recent statements from North Korea.
Asked Friday if North Korea was playing games ahead of the summit, Trump responded, “Everyone plays games.""
North Korea hardened its rhetoric toward the US on Thursday, lashing out after remarks by Vice President Mike Pence and the White House national security adviser, John Bolton, that had linked the country with Libya. Choe Son Hui, vice-minister of foreign affairs, called Pence “stupid"" and a “political dummy,"" according to an English-language statement from KCNA.
Trump then issued his own threat in a letter to Kim. “You talk about your nuclear capabilities, but ours are so massive and powerful that I pray to God they will never have to be used,"" Trump wrote.

[DOC_4]
WASHINGTON — President Trump opened the door on Tuesday to a phased dismantling of North Korea’s nuclear weapons program, backing away from his demand that the North’s leader, Kim Jong-un, completely abandon his arsenal without any reciprocal American concessions.
The president’s hint of flexibility came after North Korea declared last week that it would never agree to unilaterally surrender its weapons, even threatening to cancel the much-anticipated summit meeting between Mr. Kim and Mr. Trump scheduled for next month in Singapore.
Mr. Trump’s statement seemed less a policy shift than an effort to preserve his date with Mr. Kim. But while the gesture may avoid a swift rejection by Mr. Kim, it shows that Mr. Trump is willing to give up what for months has been his bedrock position in dealing with the North. And it demonstrates that three weeks before the June 12 meeting, the White House is still groping for a strategy to negotiate with a reclusive, suspicious nuclear-weapons state.
The scale of North Korea’s program, Mr. Trump said, would make it difficult to dismantle it in a single step. “It would certainly be better if it were all in one,” he said. “Does it have to be? I don’t think I want to totally commit myself.”
The president’s comments, delivered as he welcomed President Moon Jae-in of South Korea to the Oval Office, were the latest move in a battle of wits between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim, two leaders who both clearly want to talk but recognize the deep gulf that separates them.
Mr. Trump expressed continued enthusiasm for the meeting, saying he believed it could usher in a new era of prosperity for North Korea and safety for Mr. Kim. But he acknowledged that after North Korea’s shift in tone, the meeting could be delayed.
“There’s a very substantial chance that it won’t work out, and that’s O.K.,” Mr. Trump told reporters, as Mr. Moon listened. “That doesn’t mean it won’t work over a period of time. But it may not work out for June 12.”
More on South Korea
Halloween Catastrophe: A year after 159 revelers were crushed to death on Halloween weekend in Seoul, relatives say the South Korean government still has not taken responsibility.
So Many Protests: Distrustful of their government, South Koreans have a penchant for taking all manner of grievances to the streets, so much so that demonstrating has turned into a kind of national pastime.
A Queer K-Pop Group: In conservative South Korea, few L.G.B.T.Q. entertainers have ever come out. The young members of QI.X don’t see the point of staying in.
The Joy in the Journey: In Seoul, the subway fare is free for those older than 65, and so some retired people spend their days riding the trains to the end of the line.
“There are certain conditions we want to happen,” he added. “I think we’ll get those conditions. And if we don’t, we won’t have the meeting.”
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who has met twice with Mr. Kim to make arrangements for the meeting, expressed optimism that it would still take place. But he warned that there would likely be more twists and turns before the two leaders shook hands in Singapore.
Mr. Trump has done little to hide his excitement about that prospect. The White House has even issued a commemorative coin for the meeting that depicts the two men, in profile, facing each other, and refers to Mr. Kim as the “Supreme Leader.” But inside the White House, one official said, there was confusion about what will happen on June 12 — or whether a meeting will happen at all.
Mr. Trump said he detected a change in Mr. Kim after he met China’s president, Xi Jinping, this month in the coastal Chinese city of Dalian. He suggested that Mr. Xi, whom he described as a “world-class poker player,” encouraged Mr. Kim to harden his approach to the United States, in part to gain leverage in trade negotiations between China and the United States.
“There was a different attitude by the North Korean folks after that meeting,” Mr. Trump said. “I can’t say that I’m happy about it.”
The threatening words between Pyongyang and Washington have also raised the pressure on Mr. Moon, who has acted as a kind of go-between for Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim. His diplomacy set the stage for the Singapore summit meeting, and he has urged Mr. Trump to push for a historic breakthrough with the North, saying that such an achievement would make him a candidate for a Nobel Peace Prize.
Turning to Mr. Moon, Mr. Trump asked him whether he believed that Mr. Xi was influencing Mr. Kim. Mr. Moon deflected the question, though he conceded there was skepticism in the United States about the prospects for a successful negotiation. He said Mr. Trump’s participation set this process apart from previous ones.
“The person who is in charge is President Trump,” Mr. Moon said. “I have every confidence that he will be able to make a historic turnaround in this sense.”
Though Mr. Moon’s visit had been scheduled for weeks, Mr. Trump called him on Saturday, ahead of his visit, suggesting the depth of uncertainty he feels about the harsh words from Pyongyang. North Korea objected particularly to John R. Bolton, Mr. Trump’s new national security adviser, who said recently he viewed Libya as a template for negotiating the denuclearization of North Korea.
Mr. Trump subsequently disavowed Mr. Bolton’s remarks, acknowledging that Libya’s voluntary disarmament in 2003 did nothing to protect its leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, from being killed by his own people less than a decade later in the upheavals that swept the Arab world.
On Tuesday, Mr. Trump went out of his way to guarantee Mr. Kim’s safety. “He will be safe. He will be happy. His country will be rich,” the president said.
Analysts noted it was not clear how the United States would protect Mr. Kim from a domestic uprising like the one that convulsed Libya.
Mr. Moon sought assurances of his own — not least that the United States will maintain American troop levels in South Korea, regardless of its negotiation with Mr. Kim. Mr. Trump has long expressed a desire to withdraw troops, and the National Security Council has asked the Pentagon to prepare options for changing levels of military forces.
Still, South Korean officials said Mr. Moon delivered an essentially upbeat message to Mr. Trump.
“We believe there is a 99.9 percent chance the North Korea-U.S. summit will be held as scheduled,” Mr. Moon’s national security adviser, Chung Eui-yong, said to reporters traveling to Washington. “But we’re just preparing for many different possibilities.”
Most analysts said they believed the meeting would still happen because both leaders were so invested in it.
“But the notion that this would be an easy win, with North Korea turning over a new leaf and trading in its nukes for the embrace of the free world, is dissipating in the president’s mind,” said Victor D. Cha, a Korea expert at Georgetown University who was briefly considered as ambassador to Seoul by the Trump administration. “There are no fairy tale endings with North Korea.”
Jung Pak, a former C.I.A. analyst now at the Brookings Institution, said, “In effect, President Trump is getting a mini-lesson in talking to the North Koreans even before he talks to the North Koreans.”
Mr. Trump’s flexibility on when and how North Korea would dismantle its program, some analysts said, was a welcome recognition of reality. The idea of packing up North Korea’s sprawling nuclear program and flying it out of the country on American military transport planes was always far-fetched.
“Trump believed he was going to get complete denuclearization, and now he realizes he’s not,” said Michael J. Green, senior vice president for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “So now they’re trying to find a credible way to claim this summit will lead to denuclearization.”
A spokesman for Mr. Moon said he and Mr. Trump had agreed to join efforts to make sure the summit meeting came off as planned. The two leaders, the spokesman said, discussed “ways to address the sense of insecurity North Korea could have after it declared complete denuclearization for the first time.”
Other experts in South Korea said there were still high hopes for the Trump-Kim encounter, and that the White House should not get rattled.
“There may be a sense here that the Trump team is overreacting to North Korea’s pushback last week and losing sight of the big picture,” said John Delury, an associate professor of Chinese studies at Yonsei University in South Korea.
“Of course gaps remain in terms of negotiating peace and denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,” Mr. Delury said. “That’s the reason a negotiation is necessary.”","President Trump has suggested that the dismantling of North Korea's nuclear program might occur through a phased approach, signaling a shift from his earlier demand that the country completely abandon its nuclear arsenal without reciprocal U.S. concessions. This flexibility is seen as an effort to preserve the scheduled summit with Kim Jong-un, acknowledging the complexity of denuclearizing North Korea in one step. Trump expressed enthusiasm for the meeting but admitted that it might be delayed. The White House is navigating a challenging negotiation with a reclusive nuclear-armed state.

MUMBAI:  Equity benchmark indices declined in early trade on Thursday, falling for the second day running, amid weak trends in global markets and fresh foreign fund outflows. Disappointing earnings from IT services company Wipro also dragged the benchmarks lower. The 30-share BSE Sensex plunged 490.44 points to 65,386.58. The Nifty fell 137.5 points to 19,533.60. Among the Sensex firms, Wipro fell by nearly 4 per cent after the IT services company reported an almost flat consolidated net profit at Rs 2,667.3 crore for the September quarter, trailing street expectations, and projected up to 3.5 per cent fall in revenue in the current quarter on weak global economic outlook and uncertain business environment.

India and China are projected to jointly contribute about half of the world’s growth in both 2023 and 2024, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said in its latest Regional Economic Outlook (Asia and Pacific) report.
India’s economy is projected to grow at 6.3% in FY24 and FY25 – the fastest among the major economies of the world, while China’s economy is likely to grow at 5% in 2023 and 4.2% in 2024. The IMF said that “strong” private demand yielded positive growth surprises in the country. In Q1FY24, India’s economy grew at 7.8%. The private financial consumption expenditure during the quarter grew at 6% year-on-year as against 2.8% in Q4FY23.
The upward revision of India’s FY24 growth forecast by 20 basis points by the IMF was done due to resilient domestic demand and strong investment inflows, said the agency.
On price pressures, the IMF noted that in India, Maldives, and Vietnam, headline (CPI) inflation has been only slightly higher than before the pandemic period, without clear troughs or peaks.
For FY24, the IMF has projected CPI inflation to average 5.5% in FY24 and 4.6% in FY25. The projections for both years are 10 basis points higher than the Reserve Bank of India’s estimates.
Meanwhile, the multilateral agency projected the world’s economy to grow at 3% in 2023 and 2.9% in 2024.
“Asia and Pacific will remain the most dynamic region this year, with growth expected to rise from 3.9% in 2022 to 4.6% in 2023,” the IMF noted.
However, in 2024, the agency expects Asia’s growth to slow down to 4.2% and to 3.9% in the medium-term, which would be the lowest in the past two decades except for 2020.
“Medium-term growth is expected to moderate further, to 3.9% as China’s structural slowdown and weaker productivity growth in many other economies weigh on the region—developments that reflect in part the spectre of global de-risking. Inflation is expected to fall in 2024 within central bank targets in most countries—a faster pace of disinflation than in other regions,” the IMF said.
In Asia’s advanced economies, tight financial conditions will hold back demand, while the outlook for exports will depend on price movements of global commodities (Australia, New Zealand) and the technology cycle (Korea, Singapore, Taiwan Province of China), the IMF said.
Cabinet clears sharp hikes in MSP for wheat, pulses
And in Asia’s emerging markets, “relatively accommodative” financial conditions will support domestic demand despite monetary policy tightening, but external demand and lacklustre investment will be headwinds to growth, it said.
“Medium-term prospects are clouded by risks from geo-economic fragmentation, with de-risking policies of major economies creating a potentially significant drag on growth. On the other hand, a comprehensive set of reforms in China would boost medium-term growth prospects, especially for smaller and more open economies,” the IMF said.

India and China will account for half of the global economic growth in 2023 versus just a
tenth for the US and euro area combined, said the International Monetary Fund in its
latest update to the biannual World Economic Outlook. The multilateral agency retained
its growth forecast for Asia’s third-largest economy for 2023-24 (FY24).
The on Tuesday released the January update of its World Economic Outlook,
according to which the global growth is projected to fall from an estimated 3.4 percent in
2022 to 2.9 percent in 2023, then rise to 3.1 percent in 2024.
Leading the growth charge in 2023, India continues to be seen growing over 6% this
year and next, while the upward revision of China by 0.8 percentage point sets it on
track for growth above 5% this year.
""If we look at both China and India together, they account for about 50% of world growth
in 2023 ... so a very significant contribution,"" said Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, chief
economist and director of the research department at the IMF.
""India remains a bright spot. Together with China, it will account for half of global growth
this year, versus just a tenth for the US and euro area combined. Global is
expected to decline this year but even by 2024, projected average annual headline and
core inflation will still be above pre-pandemic levels in more than 80 percent of
countries,""said Gourinchas.
The IMF said global inflation is expected to decline in 2023 but even by 2024, projected
average annual headline and core inflation would still be above pre-pandemic levels in
more than 80 per cent of countries.
Growth in India is set to decline from 6.8 per cent in 2022 (FY23) to 6.1 per cent in 2023
(FY24) before picking up to 6.8 per cent in 2024 (FY25), the global lender said while
citing “resilient domestic demand despite external headwinds”.
The Washington-based multilateral lender raised its global growth forecast for 2023 by
20 basis points to 2.9 per cent, holding that the balance of risks remained tilted to the
downside, but adverse risks had moderated since its October 2022 report.
While the IMF made a marginal upward revision to its global growth forecast for 2023, it
retained its projection for India for 2022-23 and 2023-24 at 6.1 percent and 6.8 per
cent, respectively, and termed India as a 'bright spot.'
“Our growth projections actually for India are unchanged from our October Outlook. We
have 6.8 percent growth for this current fiscal year, which runs until March, and then
we're expecting some slowdown to 6.1 percent in fiscal year 2023. And that is largely
driven by external factors,"" Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, Chief Economist and Director,
Research Department of the IMF told reporters in Washington.
""The global economy is poised to slow this year, before rebounding next year. Growth will
remain weak by historical standards, as the fight against inflation and Russia’s war in
Ukraine weigh on activity,"" said Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, Economic Counsellor and the
Director of Research of the IMF.
Despite headwinds, the outlook is less gloomy than IMF's October forecast, and could
represent a turning point, with growth bottoming out and inflation declining.
""Economic growth proved surprisingly resilient in the third quarter of last year, with
strong labor markets, robust household consumption and business investment, and
better-than-expected adaptation to the energy crisis in Europe. Inflation, too, showed
improvement, with overall measures now decreasing in most countries—even if core
inflation, which excludes more volatile energy and food prices, has yet to peak in many
countries. Elsewhere, China’s sudden re-opening paves the way for a rapid rebound in
activity. And global financial conditions have improved as inflation pressures started to
abate. This, and a weakening of the US dollar from its November high, provided some
modest relief to emerging and developing countries,"" said Gourinchas.
For advanced economies, the slowdown will be more pronounced, with a decline from 2.7
percent last year to 1.2 percent and 1.4 percent this year and next.
Nine out of 10 advanced economies will likely decelerate, said the IMF.
US growth is expected to slow to 1.4 percent in 2023 as Federal Reserve interest-rate
hikes work their way through the economy. Among major economies, only the United
Kingdom is projected to fall into recession (-0.6 per cent) in 2023, while growth in
Germany (0.1 per cent) and Russia (0.3 per cent) may remain flat.
Euro area conditions are more challenging despite signs of resilience to the energy crisis,
a mild winter, and generous fiscal support.
With the European Central Bank tightening monetary policy, and a negative terms-oftrade shock—due to the increase in the price of its imported energy—we expect growth
to bottom out at 0.7 percent this year.
Emerging market and developing economies have already bottomed out as a group, with
growth expected to rise modestly to 4 percent and 4.2 percent this year and next, noted
the IMF.
The restrictions and COVID-19 outbreaks in China dampened activity last year. With the
economy now re-opened, IMF sees its growth rebounding to 5.2 percent this year as
activity and mobility recover.
“On the upside, a stronger boost from pent-up demand in numerous economies or a
faster fall in inflation is plausible. On the downside, severe health outcomes in China
could hold back the recovery, Russia’s war in Ukraine could escalate, and tighter global
financing conditions could worsen debt distress. Financial markets could also suddenly
reprice in response to adverse inflation news, while further geopolitical fragmentation
could hamper economic progress,” it said.
In most economies, amid the cost-of-living crisis, the priority remains achieving
sustained disinflation. With tighter monetary conditions and lower growth potentially
affecting financial and debt stability, it is necessary to deploy macroprudential tools and
strengthen debt restructuring frameworks, noted the IMF.
""Accelerating COVID-19 vaccinations in China would safeguard the recovery, with positive
cross-border spillovers. Fiscal support should be better targeted at those most affected
by elevated food and energy prices, and broad-based fiscal relief measures should be
withdrawn,"" it said.","In the early hours of Thursday, the stock market in Mumbai faced a decline for the second consecutive day.

At least 140 people were killed, after a strong earthquake hit a remote pocket of Nepal, officials said early on November 4.

Moderate tremors were felt as far away as India’s capital New Delhi, nearly 500 kilometres from the quake’s epicentre. Prime Minister Pushpakamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’ headed towards the incident site with a medical team Saturday morning. Both Nepal Army and Nepal Police personnel have been mobilized to carry out rescue works, officials said.

Nepal lies on a major geological faultline where the Indian tectonic plate pushes up into the Eurasian plate, forming the Himalayas, and earthquakes are a regular occurrence. Nearly 9,000 people died in 2015 when a 7.8-magnitude quake struck Nepal, destroying more than half a million homes. Six people died in November 2022 when a 5.6-magnitude earthquake struck Doti district, near Jajarkot.

Air pollution, primarily driven by factors such as vehicular emissions, industrial processes, and urbanization, has long been associated with respiratory illnesses, cardiovascular diseases, and even premature death. The thick layers of smog in Delhi have been making it difficult to breathe, even causing problems for your eye health.
However, there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that the ramifications of air pollution extend beyond the physical domain and into the realm of mental well-being.

According to Dr. Sathish C. Reddy, consultant in interventional pulmonology at CARE Hospitals, living in an area with excessive air pollution can potentially cause mood swings. “Research suggests that exposure to air pollution, specifically fine particulate matter (PM2.5), may lead to inflammation and oxidative stress in the body, which can impact the brain and mood-regulating neurotransmitters,” he tells indianexpress.com.

In a comprehensive review conducted in 2022 and published in the journal NeuroToxicology, more than 100 studies investigating the impact of air pollution on mental health and specific brain regions responsible for regulating emotions, including the hippocampus, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex, were examined.

Pollution levels in Delhi and its surrounding areas dipped marginally overnight due to a relatively better wind speed, though the concentration of poisonous PM2.5 was still more than 80 times the healthy limit prescribed by the World Health Organization.

A thick toxic haze lingers over the city for the fifth consecutive day on Saturday, with doctors expressing concerns that air pollution is causing an increase in respiratory and eye problems among children and the elderly.

The concentration of PM2.5, fine particulate matter capable of penetrating deep into the respiratory system and triggering health problems, exceeded the government-prescribed safe limit of 60 micrograms per cubic metre by seven to eight times at multiple locations throughout Delhi-NCR.

It was 80 to 100 times the healthy limit (5 micrograms per cubic metre) set by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The air quality in Delhi-NCR declined over the past week due to a gradual drop in temperatures, calm winds that trap pollution, and a surge in post-harvest paddy straw burning across Punjab and Haryana.
Data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) shows that Delhi's Air Quality Index (AQI) increased by more than 200 points between October 27 and November 3, culminating in a descent into the ""severe plus"" category (above 450) on Friday.
However, the AQI marginally improved from 468 at 4 pm on Friday to 413 at 6 am on Saturday.
Friday's 24-hour average AQI (468) was the worst since the previous high of 471 recorded on November 12, 2021.
Delhi's air quality ranks among the worst in the world's capital cities.
A report by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago (EPIC) in August said that air pollution is shortening lives by almost 12 years in Delhi.
The hazardous pollution levels compelled many to forgo their morning walks, sports, and other outdoor activities.
Delhi L-G holds emergency meeting as air quality plummets to ‘severe plus’ 
Parents are a worried lot as health experts say children breathe faster, taking in more pollutants.
Unfavourable meteorological conditions, combined with emissions from vehicles, paddy straw burning, firecrackers, and other local pollution sources, contribute to hazardous air quality levels in Delhi-NCR during the winter every year.
According to an analysis conducted by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC), the capital experiences peak pollution from November 1 to November 15 when the number of stubble-burning incidents in Punjab and Haryana increases.
Smoke from stubble burning accounted for 35% of the PM2.5 pollution in Delhi on Friday, rising from 25% on Thursday, according to a numerical model-based system developed by the Pune-based Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology.
Officials at the Commission for Air Quality Management, a central government panel that formulates strategies to combat pollution in Delhi-NCR, expect pollution levels to further decline due to comparatively better meteorological conditions and curbs imposed on certain polluting activities, including non-essential construction work, starting Thursday.
On Friday, the commission deferred the implementation of stricter measures under the air pollution control plan, called the Graded Response Action Plan, citing a declining trend in the AQI in the region.
A day earlier, the pollution control body had ordered a ban on non-essential construction work and specific categories of polluting vehicles.","
Air pollution, driven by factors like vehicle emissions and industrial processes, has long been linked to physical health problems. However, there is increasing evidence that it also affects mental well-being. Exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in polluted areas may lead to inflammation and oxidative stress, impacting the brain and mood-regulating neurotransmitters. Studies have explored air pollution's effects on mental health and areas of the brain responsible for emotions. This underscores the far-reaching consequences of air pollution, extending beyond physical health to include mood swings and potential implications for mental well-being. The need for effective measures to combat air pollution's impact on public health is increasingly evident.",3,Environment,2023-11-04,"New Delhi, Nov. 4 (IANS) The air quality in Delhi-NCR declined over the past week due to a gradual drop in temperatures, calm winds that trap pollution, and a surge in post-harvest paddy straw burning across Punjab and Haryana.The air quality in Delhi-NCR declined over the past week due to a gradual drop in temperatures, calm winds that trap pollution, and a surge in post-harvest paddy straw burning across Punjab and Haryana."

WASHINGTON: In a major policy speech Thursday, US President Donald Trump is all set to announce a new proposal to overhaul the country's immigration policy that would give preference to foreigners based on merit rather than the existing system that gives preference to family ties, a move that could end the agonising Green Card wait for hundreds and thousands of Indian professionals.Brainchild of Trump's son-in-law, Jarred Kushner, the new plan primarily focusses on strengthening border security and revamping the system of Green Card or legal permanent residency so that people with merit, higher degrees and professional qualifications could get an easy access to the immigration system.As of now, about 66 per cent of the green cards are given to those with family ties and only 12 per cent are based on skills. The Trump Administration intends to change this. Trump is scheduled to roll out his plan at the Rose Garden of the White House Thursday afternoon.However, the plan faces an uphill task mainly because of the bitterly divided Congress on partisan lines, especially on the issue of immigration reform.Even if Trump succeeds in convincing his Republican lawmakers on this, the opposition Democrats, led by Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi, House Speaker, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, are dead against any such legislative success to the president.The Trump Administration is well aware of the issue. It is planning to make it an election issue in 2020 if the opposition Democrats are unwilling to be engaged on this, a senior administration official told reporters during an interaction on the eve of the rollout of the merit-based immigration policy. It is going to be a very detailed piece of legislation and it can be what they want it to be. If they do not want to engage, then it will be part of the election. If they want to engage, then it could be part of a negotiation. That is going to be up to them,  said the official who requested anonymity.Both Trump and Kushner are believed to have briefed Republican lawmakers on the issue.In his speech, Trump is unlikely to propose changes in the existing number -- 1.1 million -- of green cards issued each year. Instead, the new policy calls for issuing more than half of the green cards to those based on employment or skills.Such a move is likely to benefit hundreds and thousands of Indian professionals on H-1B visa whose current Green Card wait, on an average, is more than a decade.According to the details given by the senior administration official, the proposed system mirrors the point-based system of countries like Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Japan.Officials said the plan would favour those immigrants who are exceptional students, those with  extraordinary talent  and people who work in professional and specialised vocations.The applicants would receive points for age, English proficiency and offers of employment at a certain wage threshold in order to protect low-wage American workers, the official said.

UNITED NATIONS, GENEVA: A Global Assessment Report (GAR), launched by the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) here on Wednesday, has warned of new and much larger threats due to extreme climate changes to economies, in particular the Asia Pacific which accounts for 40% of the global economic losses, with the greatest impact in the largest economies of Japan, China, Korea and India.The GAR was launched at the Global Platform organised by the UNDRR here with 5,000 participants from governments, private sectors and civil society attending the five-day event which is seen as a run up to the climate conference in September, taking note of the progress made on achieving sustainable development goals. India has sent a high-level delegation headed by Prime Minister’s additional principal secretary P K Mishra.The report has outlined major risk to human life from air pollution and biological hazards, in addition to other natural disasters like floods, landslides and earthquakes. Economic losses to the extent of 4% of GDP annually are projected if countries don’t invest in DRR (disaster risk reduction). It has been estimated that an annual investment of $6 billion in DRR strategies would generate benefits of up to $360 billion each year.“Extreme changes in planetary and socio-ecological systems are happening now; we no longer have the luxury of procrastination. If we continue living in this way, engaging with each other and the planet in the way we do, then our very survival is in doubt,” said Mami Mizutori, head of UNDRR.Mizutori said countries must recognise that an international development financing system that allocates approximately 20 times the funding to emergency response, reconstruction, relief and rehabilitation activities rather than prevention and preparedness, acts counter to sustainability principles.The report says the impact in terms of losses and deaths is probably much higher than the data suggests, as disasters in several of these countries remain under-reported. “Human losses and asset losses relative to GDP tend to be higher in the countries with the least capacity to prepare, finance and respond to disasters and climate change,” the report argues.India has made major progress in achieving the goals of the Sendai Framework for DRR, adopted by all UN member countries in 2015 which talks about reducing disaster mortalities and economic losses, said Kamal Kishore, Member National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), India.Kishore, who addressed journalists along with Mizutori at the UN after the launch of the GAR, said that in the recent cyclone Fani that caused huge economic devastation in parts of Odisha, India managed to evacuate more than 1.2 million people within 24 hours and minimise human casualties by 96% compared to a similar cyclone event in the state earlier (in 1999 with over 10,000 deaths).The report urges governments to put the Sendai Framework into action, shifting focus from disaster management to reducing risk.Adopted by UN member states in 2015, the Sendai Framework aims to reduce disaster deaths economic losses and strengthen risk governance by building resilience and investing in early warning system.

The United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) launched a significant Global Assessment Report (GAR) in Geneva, sounding a dire warning about the increasingly severe threats posed by extreme climate changes to economies around the world. The report underscores that these threats are particularly acute in the Asia Pacific region, responsible for a staggering 40% of the global economic losses. The largest economies in the region, including Japan, China, Korea, and India, are expected to bear the brunt of these impacts. The launch of the GAR took place during the Global Platform event in Geneva, attended by 5,000 participants from governments, the private sector, and civil society. This event is considered a precursor to the climate conference scheduled for September, taking stock of the progress made in achieving sustainable development goals. India, for its part, sent a high-level delegation led by Prime Minister's additional principal secretary, P.K. Mishra.

The GAR report serves as a stark reminder of the major risks that climate change poses not only to the environment but also to human life. It highlights the dangers of air pollution, biological hazards, and other natural disasters such as floods, landslides, and earthquakes. The report warns that if countries do not invest in disaster risk reduction (DRR) strategies, they could face annual economic losses amounting to 4% of their GDP. However, it also offers a glimmer of hope, estimating that an annual investment of $6 billion in DRR strategies could yield benefits of up to $360 billion each year.

Mami Mizutori, the head of UNDRR, emphasized the urgency of the situation, stating, ""Extreme changes in planetary and socio-ecological systems are happening now; we no longer have the luxury of procrastination. If we continue living in this way, engaging with each other and the planet in the way we do, then our very survival is in doubt."" She stressed the need for countries to rethink their approach to financing, pointing out that the current international development financing system allocates around 20 times more funding to emergency response, reconstruction, relief, and rehabilitation activities than to prevention and preparedness, which contradicts sustainability principles.

The GAR report not only raises concerns about the economic losses and human casualties attributed to natural disasters but also suggests that these figures might be higher than reported due to underreporting of disasters in several countries. It asserts that countries with limited capacity to prepare, finance, and respond to disasters and climate change tend to experience higher human and asset losses relative to their GDP.

India, however, was singled out as a nation that has made significant progress in achieving the goals outlined in the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR), a global initiative adopted by all UN member countries in 2015. The framework aims to reduce disaster-related deaths and economic losses while strengthening risk governance and investing in early warning systems. Kamal Kishore, a member of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) in India, highlighted the country's successful efforts in disaster management. He cited the example of Cyclone Fani, which caused extensive economic devastation in parts of Odisha. India managed to evacuate over 1.2 million people within 24 hours, reducing human casualties by 96% compared to a similar cyclone event in the state in 1999, which resulted in over 10,000 deaths.

The GAR report calls on governments worldwide to put the Sendai Framework into action, shifting their focus from disaster management to proactive risk reduction. While many nations, including India, have taken significant steps in this direction, there is a collective responsibility to accelerate efforts to mitigate the growing threats posed by climate change and other natural disasters. The Sendai Framework Monitoring platform, designed to assess the progress made by partner countries, serves as a vital tool for tracking and evaluating these efforts. India, like other countries, must continue reporting its economic losses and other targets to ensure that the framework's objectives are met and global resilience against disasters is strengthened.","The United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) has released a Global Assessment Report (GAR) warning of the severe threats posed by extreme climate changes to economies worldwide, particularly in the Asia Pacific region.

Pakistan today “successfully” test-fired a medium range surface-to-surface ballistic missile Hatf-IV, which can carry nuclear warheads and hit targets within the range of 750 km covering several parts of India.

An official announcement here said the indigenously built missile was test-fired after a due notification was given to the neighbours.

The test was to check the technical aspects of the missile, also known as Shaheen, foreign office spokesman Aziz Ahmed Khan was quoted by official APP news agency as saying. “It is in line with testing the technical aspects of the indigenously produced missile. It has nothing to do with the Indo-Pak situation but to test the technical aspects of the missile,” he said.

The missile was reported to have been test-fired from a test range on the Somyani coast.

Asked about the current Indo-Pak tension, he said all neighbouring countries were informed prior to the testing of the missile.

India was reportedly informed yesterday evening when the Indian Charge d’ Affaires Sudhir Vyas was called to the foreign office here for a meeting.

London: Britain today expressed concern over the latest missile test by Pakistan in the midst of border stand-off with India and said restraint in developing nuclear weapons and possible delivery systems was in Islamabad’s interest.

“I regret Pakistan’s decision to test a ballistic missile, particularly in the light of the continuing heightened tension in the region,” British Foreign Office Minister Mike O’Brien said.

Foreign Secretary Kanwal Sibal today said Pakistan’s test-firing of Hatf-IV medium-range surface-to-surface ballistic missile was “a provocation to the international community and a further act of irresponsible behaviour.”

Answering questions at a press conference, he described Pakistan’s missile test as “antics” as these were clandestinely-procured missiles already made and tested elsewhere.

The mystery behind the suspected droppings at a village in North Dinajpur district near the Indo-Bangladesh border where an unidentified airplane had apparently intruded into the Indian airspace deepened today with the Indian Air Force (IAF) saying that none of its aircraft was flying over the area at that time.

Although the IAF is still continuing with investigations, specialists from the Eastern Air Command have also ruled out the possibility of any air-dropping.

An Mi-17 helicopter with specialists from the Eastern Air Command landed at the village at 5.30 am for an on-the-spot inspection of the pond where something was reported to have been dropped from air and found no evidence, an IAF spokesman said here.

“Every square inch of the pond has been checked by the local police and the BSF and nothing has been found. There is no evidence on ground to suggest any air-dropping,” he said. The IAF team spoke to the local population, authorities and police of the village which is 2 km away from the Bangladesh border.

Reports that the water in the pond changed colour is absolutely baseless, the spokesman said, adding that the statement of an 11-year-old girl bathing in the pond had not been corroborated.

The IAF spokesman also said: “There was no IAF aircraft flying over the place where the incident is supposed to have taken place”. He was reacting to reports that the incident could have been a fallout of an IAF air drill that was being conducted in the area.

He, however, could not confirm whether any other aircraft was flying over the area at that time. He said investigations were still under way. The mystery plane was suspected to have dropped sack-like objects over the area near the border.

he Supreme Court on Monday directed Maharashtra Assembly Speaker Rahul Narwekar to decide disqualification petitions filed under the Tenth Schedule (anti-defection law) of the Constitution against the Chief Minister Eknath Shinde camp in the Shiv Sena dispute by December 31, 2023.A three-judge Bench led by Chief Justice D.Y. Chandrachud ordered the Speaker, in his capacity as a tribunal under the Tenth Schedule, to decide the disqualification petitions against the breakaway faction headed by Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar in the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) dispute by January 31, 2024.

“So we are giving the Speaker two months to decide the disqualification petitions in the Shiv Sena case and a month more in the Nationalist Congress Party case. That is fair. It is reasonable time,” Chief Justice Chandrachud addressed the lawyers on both sides.

The Chief Justice said the need to bind the Speaker to deadlines had come after giving him repeated opportunities to conclude the disqualification proceedings.

The court took matters into its hands after the Secretary, Maharashtra Legislative Assembly Secretariat, filed an affidavit that the Speaker could only decide by February 29, 2024.

Before election

“We do not want this to creep into the next election schedule… The proceedings cannot wrangle on until the next elections are announced. This has to come to an end within a fixed date,” Chief Justice Chandrachud responded firmly to the affidavit during the hearing.

He noted that a Constitution Bench had directed the Speaker in May to conclude and pronounce the final orders in the Shiv Sena case. “Our Constitution Bench judgment was in May 2023. The incident [Shiv Sena split] happened in 2022,” Chief Justice Chandrachud pointed out the delay.

There are 34 disqualification petitions pending before the Speaker in the Shiv Sena case and nine in the NCP matter.

Chief Minister M.K. Stalin on Monday alleged that the Raj Bhavan was functioning like the office of the BJP. He saAddressing the media after paying tributes to Muthuramalinga Thevar at the 116th Thevar Jayanthi celebrations and the 61st Guru Puja of the freedom fighter at Pasumpon in Ramanathapuram district, he said the Governor’s office had been giving factually incorrect statements on many issues.

On the hurling of a petrol bomb near the Raj Bhavan in Chennai, Mr. Stalin said that despite a comprehensive clarification from the police on the action taken over the incident, and the available evidence in the form of video footage, the Governor’s office had issued a statement giving the impression that the petrol bomb was hurled at the Raj Bhavan. “It had fallen on the road,” he said.

Moreover, the police took swift action. There was no compromise on the maintenance of law and order, he said. “When such was the case, the statements given by the Raj Bhavan on every issue were not only wrong, but also incorrect,” the Chief Minister said, justifying his description of the Raj Bhavan as the BJP’s office.

The Governor, the Chief Minister said, did not seem to have understood the difference between ‘Dravidam’ and ‘Aryam’. According to Mr. Stalin, ‘Dravidam’ meant “everything for everyone”, while ‘Aryam’ denoted that certain things were meant for select people (Yellorukum yellam yenasolvathu Dravidam, innarku Ithuthaan yenbathu Aryam ).

On the demand from some sections to name the Madurai airport after Muthuramalinga Thevar, Mr. Stalin said a proposal had been sent to the Union government. Hailing the late Forward Bloc leader as someone who was liked by all, Mr. Stalin recalled the long association between Thevar and former Chief Minister Karunanidhi. After the demise of Thevar, when Karunanidhi was the Chief Minister, he had announced that the State government would celebrate the centenary birth anniversary of Thevar in 2007. During this period, infrastructure was built in Pasumpon at an investment of ₹2.50 crore, he said. He pointed out that the State government had announced that it would build two mandapams at a cost of ₹1.5 crore for the public to pay tributes to Thevar at Pasumpon.

To a query on the fishermen issue, the Chief Minister said he had written to the Prime Minister and the External Affairs Minister. Expressing concern over the arrest of fishermen, he said senior DMK leader and MP T.R. Baalu would meet the Union Minister and press the Centre to bring the fishermen lodged in Sri Lankan prisons home.

Mr. Stalin was accompanied by his ministerial colleagues K.K.S.S.R. Ramachandran, Thangam Thennarasu, K.R. Periakaruppan, R.S. Raja Kannappan, P. Moorthy, P.T.R.

When some AIADMK functionaries confronted them, they claimed that they were only protesting against the expulsion of V.K. Sasikala from the party.

Similarly, when Mr. Palaniswami’s convoy was approaching Abiramam, a person hurled a footwear at it. Police personnel accompanying the former Chief Minister immediately nabbed the person from the crowd and took him away.

After paying homage, Mr. Palaniswami told mediapersons that it was late Chief Minister Jayalalithaa who contributed the gold armour for Thevar’s statue.

He also recalled the contributions of the AIADMK stalwarts to the Mukkalathor community.

A  mob comprising members of the dominant intermediate community, allegedly supported by local AIADMK functionaries, vandalised a Scheduled Caste hamlet in Sokkadi Village in Krishnagiri on Sunday.
According to the police, the trouble started after some residents of an Adi Dravidar colony objected to stone polishing work being done in the vicinity. It was for a community temple being built by a dominant caste group. The residents said the stone dust from the work had been entering their homes for the past few days.

Following this, AIADMK’s Krishnagiri west union secretary Sokkadi Rajan arrived and allegedly got into a spat with some other Scheduled Caste (SC) youth in the vicinity, reportedly hurling casteist slurs. This ended in fisticuffs. By evening, over 30 police personnel had been stationed in the village.

The villagers alleged that despite the police presence, the members of the dominant caste gathered and were joined by Mr. Rajan’s brother Sadasivam, Panchayat president Podila Ramalingam and her husband Ramalingam, all belonging to the AIADMK. The police were outnumbered, and the group pelted stones at houses in the SC neighbourhood. Houses were also vandalised and the pelted stones injured 10 persons from the Adi Dravidar colony. The police hastily convened a peace meeting on Monday morning, which did not see attendance.

Speaking to The Hindu, Dilli Babu, CPI(M)’s ex-MLA of Harur, who visited the village, said the local AIADMK functionaries had egged on the vandals. “The police does not have the authority to summon a peace meeting. It is the job of the Revenue Department. Without addressing the concerns of the people, some of whom are in the hospital with injuries, they cannot summarily call for a ‘peace meeting’,” he contended.

He demanded that cases be registered under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, and that the panchayat president be stripped of the post.

Calls to the Deputy Superintendent of Police Tamilarasi, were not answered.

Tamil Nadu Congress Committee’s legislature party leader K. Selvaperunthagai on Monday called for immediate action against Mr. Rajan and Ms. Ramalingam. In a statement, he said those who indulged in violence against Dalits and caused social tensions should be charged and arrested under the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989.

“I urge Chief Minister M.K. Stalin to intervene in this issue and punish those responsible. Those affected in this violence should be given appropriate compensation and medical treatment,” Mr. Selvaperunthagai added.","Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K.

Rural demand accounts for a third of consumer goods companies’ revenues, indicating the state of the rural economy. But in Q2FY24, some of these companies have done well, while others have not, raising doubts about revival in rural demand. Mint delves deeper.


Is there a revival in rural demand?

What impacted rural consumption?
Rural demand was hit hard by the second wave of the covid-19 pandemic. It never really recovered from there. Unseasonal rainfall in the first quarter of 2023-24 resulted in significant crop damage and lower output. In the second quarter, the erratic monsoon hurt crop sowing. Add to that higher inflation which meant costlier food and other essential items. In fact, rural inflation in September 2023 was higher at 5.33% than urban inflation of 4.65%. Hit by higher costs and lower income, rural consumers held back their non-essential spending, delaying further the revival in rural demand.

What explains the growth in consumption in 2022-23?
It grew 7.5%, driven by urban demand. Consumers in cities spent, confident of their future. The Reserve Bank of India’s consumer confidence index touched a 4-year high in September. RBI data showed rising household liabilities as consumers borrowed and splurged. A NielsenIQ study shows a 10% urban volume growth as against rural’s 7% in Q2FY24.


How critical is rural demand for India?
The bulk of India lives in rural areas. A strong rural economy is a pre-requisite for faster economic growth as it fuels consumption, an important engine of growth. In FY23, India was able to post a 7.2% GDP growth thanks to strong growth in private consumption. This consumption growth came largely from the urban centres. If India has to consistently register a GDP growth in excess of 8%, rural consumption has to be strong. That would need a good monsoon, strong agricultural output and good prices for the produce.

What is the outlook for rural demand?
Some consumer companies are seeing green shoots as they head into the festival season. Most of them are hoping for a turnaround in rural consumption. But a lot will depend on water levels in the reservoirs and crop output as the Southwest monsoon has been erratic. Global factors are also at play. Oil prices have risen due to the Israel-Palestine conflict. This could push up inflation in India. Price increase affects the rural population a lot more than urban consumers and any revival in rural demand will have to wait.

DUBAI: Oversupply in crude markets could take months or even years to fix depending on when producers outside Opec cut their output, Abu Dhabibased The National reported, citing comments by UAE energy minister Suhail Al Mazrouei. “We are experiencing an obvious oversupply in the market that needs time to be absorbed,” the newspaper reported Mazrouei as saying in e-mailed comments. The United Arab Emirates supported the November decision by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries to maintain production. The National reported Mazrouei as saying. Brent crude, a pricing benchmark for more than half of the world’s oil, tumbled 48% last year, the most since 2008. Opec decided on November 27 to maintain production instead of cutting output to eliminate a surplus left by increased supplies from the US to Russia. “Depending on the actual production growth from non-Opec countries, this problem could take months or even years,” the UAE’s Mazrouei was quoted as saying in The National, referring to oversupply. “If they act rationally, we can see positive corrections during 2015.” Saudi Arabia won’t cut its output, though producers outside the group are welcome to do so, Ali Al-Naimi, that country’s oil minister, said at a conference in Abu Dhabi on December 21. Opec would find it “difficult, if not impossible” to give up part of its share in global oil markets by cutting output, he said on December 19. Mazrouei said Opec didn’t contribute to putting too much crude up for sale “and shall not be blamed if other non-Opec countries oversupply the market,” according to The National. UAE oil output averaged 2.77 million barrels a day last year, down from 2.92 million barrels daily in August 2013, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Saudi oil production at 9.5 million barrels a day is near a three-decade high of 10 million barrels daily reached in September. Opec production at 30.2 million barrels a day in December exceeded the group’s own 30 million barrel a day target for a seventh consecutive month, according to the data compiled by Bloomberg. Saudi Arabia and the UAE have boosted output this decade to compensate for losses in Opec production from countries such as Libya and Iran.

NEW DELHI: The government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) are evaluating a proposal that seeks to nudge large borrowers into meeting working capital requirements from the debt market and not from banks as they do so now. The aim is to release bank funds for lower-rated companies besides further deepening the corporate bond market. The key element of the proposal is that companies with a working capital limit of Rs 100 crore or more should finance the core component of this through the bond market. “Large corporates are best suited to access the corporate bond market for their credit needs,” said a senior government official who was part of deliberations on the plan. RBI is expected to hold discussions with the Indian Banks Association (IBA) over the issue as part of its strategy for “alternative approaches to working capital financing for corporates.” The central bank is also expected to issue a discussion paper on the issue. “We are also in talks with the market regulator, Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), which is primarily in favour of releasing bank funds for lower-rated companies,” the official added. According to a senior IBA functionary, some banks had raised questions on the proposal, which was discussed at a recent meeting. “Sharing of securities and collateral between bond holders and working capital providers would be a challenge in view of drawing power related issues,” he said. The government, however, is of view that banks are often required to resort to expensive emergency funding to meet prudential obligations, posing serious liquidity problems. “Such an arrangement (as per the proposal) will have a dual advantage. First, it will help banks manage their funds effectively and second it will help in the development of the nascent bond market,” said the official cited above. Last year, RBI allowed banks to issue bonds with a minimum maturity of seven years to raise resources for lending to long-term projects in infrastructure sub-sectors and affordable housing. IBA has also suggested a model in which around 50% of working capital limit sanctioned to large borrowers can be met through a combination of a bill discounting limit and a working capital demand loan limit (WCDL) limit. “We are in consultations and RBI will soon come up with a structured discussion paper before finalising any terms,” the official added. Experts said the depth of the debt capital market has improved significantly in the last 10 years and that such an initiative would help enhance it. “Both RBI and the government want to de-risk the concentration risk of large banks to large borrowers,” said KPMG (India) partner Harshvardhan Bisht. In order to implement the recommendations, RBI and the government will have to help simplify procedures for taking charge of securities and collateral, so that the end borrower - the bank or bond market - have a secured asset in the event of any defaults, he said.

NEW DELHI: The Coal Ministry officials had ""connived"" with the JSPL, headed by former Congress MP Naveen Jindal, allowing it to ""illegally"" mine nearly three times more coal than permitted, claims a CBI probe into coal block allocation scam. The agency, which has incorporated these details in the FIR in the case, has alleged that the Ministry officials in connivance with the company not only overlooked the excess mining but also regularised it. The case relates to the ongoing probe of the CBI into the coal scam in which it had registered an FIR against the company alleging that instead of adhering to the rate of extraction of coal as provided in the approved Mine Plan, the company had resorted to ""illegal excess mining"". In the FIR, which has now been accessed, the agency has alleged that according to data available ""on record"" while the approved coal production during 1998-99 to 2002-03 was 1.35 MT, the actual coal production by the Company was 5.9 MT which is an excess of 4.55 MT (nearly 300 per cent above the sanctioned extraction) of coal mined ""irregularly"". Defending its position, JSPL spokesperson claimed that the production schedules mentioned for the first five years in the Mine Plans were based on the guidelines mentioned under MCR 1960 Rule 22 (5) wherein the RQP (Registered Qualified Person) who prepares the mine plan gives a tentative scheme of mining and annual plan for excavation from year to year for five years. The spokesperson said it may, therefore, be noted that as per the approved capacity of two million tonnes per annum production for the first five years was below the cumulative year wise capacity of 10 MT and hence there was no excess mining as alleged. The agency has alleged that there was excess coal mining in all the five years against the rate approved in Mine Plan and no prior permission was obtained from the Coal Ministry. The excess mining came ""on record"" during presentation made by the Company before Standing Committee of Coal Ministry for revised Mine Plan in 2004 but the Ministry ""did not take any action"" against the company, the CBI alleged. The role of RQP has also come under the scanner of the CBI which has alleged that the RQP who prepared the irregular mine plan was suspended by the Coal Ministry after irregular mining lease came to the notice of the Ministry but no action was taken against the company. ""Interestingly, though he was suspended the same RQP was again instrumental in preparation of revised mine plan of 2008,"" the agency alleged. According to the CBI, the company continued ""unauthorised"" excess extraction of coal in the years 2003-04 and 2004-05 (ruled by NDA and UPA governments respectively) without the approval of Coal Ministry. The agency has alleged that excess coal mined during 2003-04 and 2004-05 was 1.431 MT over and above 4.55 MT excess coal mentioned above. It is alleged that while Standing Committee in May 2004 has stated that to increase the production to meet coal requirement for a plant the company needs the approval of the screening committee but another Standing Committee held on March 21, 2005 approved the increase in production from two MTPA to five MTPA for a period of three years. The JSPL spokesperson said even for the first six years the coal production remained with in 12 MT (11.29) though there were ""slight deviations"" in the year 2003-04 and 2004-05 beyond the annual approved capacity. ""These deviations were duly brought to the knowledge of Ministry of Coal, Government of India in the draft revised Mine Plan and the same was duly approved by the ministry Chhattisgarh Environment Conservation Board (CECB) issued the consent to operate which also duly regularised such minor deviation. ""Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Rairgarh had also found no irregularity in such minor deviations (in a case filed by CECB) which had been duly regularised by the Government of India and the State Government,"" the spokesperson said. The ""regularisation"" claimed by JSPL has also come under the scrutiny of the agency which alleged that the company ""resorted to misappropriation of coal through excess mining and got the excess coal mined regularised in alleged connivance with officials of Ministry of Coal.""

The latest annual KPMG `Global Automotive Executive Survey’ 2015, now in its sixteenth year, found that for the next five years, respondents see consumers still fixated on traditional product issues that will drive their purchasing decisions.","A CBI probe into a coal block allocation scam in India alleges that officials from the Coal Ministry collaborated with JSPL, a company led by former Congress MP Naveen Jindal, allowing it to engage in ""illegal"" coal mining nearly three times more than permitted. The agency claims the Ministry officials overlooked and regularized the excess mining. JSPL has defended itself, stating that the production was within approved limits. The CBI investigation also brings into question the role of the Registered Qualified Person (RQP) who prepared the irregular mine plan and was later suspended but allowed to work on a revised mine plan in 2008.",4,Business and Finance,2015-01-08,"The CBI is expected to hold discussions with the Indian Banks Association (IBA) over the issue as part of its strategy for ""alternative approaches to working capital financing for corporates.""

Gandhi described the contest between the two parties as the battle of the ideologies of Gandhi and GodseBhopal: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Saturday pledged to conduct a caste census in the country if his party was voted to power at the Centre.

Reiterating that the Congress is promoting love and brotherhood while the BJP is spreading hatred, Mr Gandhi described the contest between the two parties as the battle of the ideologies of Gandhi and Godse.


Addressing a public meeting on the sidelines of the Congress' ""Jan Akrosh Yatra"" at Polaykala under Shajapur district in Madhya Pradesh, Mr Gandhi said that a caste census will alone ensure inclusive development in the country, giving justice to different communities, including the OBCs.

“This (caste census) is the biggest issue before the country today. If the Congress comes to power at the Centre, the first thing the party will do is conduct a caste census and make the data on the populations of all the communities public,” he said.

Mr Gandhi claimed that the Congress government at the Centre had earlier conducted the caste census. But Prime Minister Narendra Modi was not keen to make the census data public, depriving different communities of their true participation in power.


The Congress leader also demanded the provision of an OBC quota in the women’s reservation before its implementation.

Mr Gandhi said that the Congress is fighting the ideologies of the RSS and the BJP since the saffron parties are spreading hatred in society, whereas his party is promoting love and brotherhood.

Mr Gandhi accused Mr Modi of implementing the RSS agenda to spread hatred and violence.

The Congress leader attacked the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government for failing to provide a fair price to the farmers for their produce.

He said that the Congress government in Chhattisgarh has given a fair price to the farmers for their produce by procuring paddy from them at `2,500 per quintal.


Mr Gandhi claimed that 18,000 farmers in Madhya Pradesh committed suicide due to the denial of a fair price for their produce in the last 18 years.

He termed Madhya Pradesh as the ""epicentre of corruption"" in India and said that farmers and youth of the state had told him during his Madhya Pradesh leg of the ""Bharat Jodo Yatra"" that the scale of corruption in the state is much higher than that in the rest of the country.

He alleged corruption in the midday meal scheme in the state.

Mr Gandhi said that a scandal broke out in the admission of MBBS courses in different medical colleges in the state, in which seats were found to be sold.


Mr Gandhi also accused corruption in the construction of a holy place like ""Mahakal Lok""","Bhopal: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Saturday pledged to conduct a caste census in the country if his party was voted to power at the Centre.

“This (caste census) is the biggest issue before the country today. If the Congress comes to power at the Centre, the first thing the party will do is conduct a caste census and make the data on the populations of all the communities public,” he said.

Mr Gandhi claimed that the Congress government at the Centre had earlier conducted the caste census. But Prime Minister Narendra Modi was not keen to make the census data public, depriving different communities of their true participation in power.",5,National News,2023-10-16,"A 38-year-old woman accused of extorting several men by honey trapping them, was allegedly physically assaulted and paraded with footwear garland by a group of angry villagers in Karnataka's Belagavi district, police said on Monday. The woman was later rescued by the police and admitted to a nearby hospital where she is undergoing treatment for her minor injuries, they said."

The top Indian leadership’s talks with the visiting Russian President Vladimir Putin resulted in a significant progress on wide-ranging issues, including two of immense strategic importance: the India-Russia-China axis and the two countries’ political will to close ranks in fighting the scourge of terrorism.

During the day-long talks Mr Putin had with Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, Deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani, External Affairs Minister Yashwant Sinha and a host of other leaders, the two countries agreed to enhance intelligence-sharing on Al-Qaida and Taliban cadres and a greater military-to-military cooperation, well-placed sources in the Vajpayee government told ‘The Tribune’ tonight.

The two countries today signed eight agreements, significantly none on defence deals. The Delhi Declaration lays stress on further consolidation of strategic partnership. A Joint Declaration was inked on strengthening and enhancing economic, scientific and technological cooperation. The two also issued a Joint Statement stressing the importance of “Islamabad implementing in full its obligations and promises to prevent the infiltration of terrorists across the Line of Control into Jammu and Kashmir and at other points across the border as well as to eliminate terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-controlled territory as a prerequisite for the renewal of the peaceful dialogue” between New Delhi and Islamabad.

Later in the evening, Mr Putin minced no words when in his joint press conference with Mr Vajpayee, he backed India’s stand advised Pakistan to not only put a stop to the infiltration of terrorists into India but also “liquidate its entire terrorism infrastructure.” Both Mr Putin and Mr Vajpayee said the Indo-Russian relations by now were reaching “newer targets”, had transcended a buyer-seller relationship and acquired strategic overtones.

On the sensitive question of the much-hyped India-Russia-China axis, a senior official remarked, “The progress on this issue was satisfactory and significant ground was achieved. On such issues, ground is made millimetre by millimetre, not mile by mile.”

Mr Vajpayee, in his opening remarks at the joint press interaction, said both India and Russia strongly opposed terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and pledged to work bilaterally and through international fora to combat the menace. He favoured evolving strong defence mechanisms in tackling terrorism in a coordinated manner.

“The fight against terrorism must not admit of any double standards and should also target the financial and other sources of support to terrorism”, the two countries said in a joint statement, while referring to Pakistan’s continued and open support to cross border terrorism.

India and Russia today called upon the international community to target not only those who perpetrate acts of terrorism but also those who assist, finance, sponsor or otherwise abet terrorists.At a banquet hosted in honour of Russian President Vladimir Putin tonight, President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam stressed the need for shedding “double standards” in the global fight against terrorism and said the struggle against terrorism would not succeed if it was not conducted in an integrated manner on a global plane.

President Putin in his speech said, “We are jointly fighting international terrorism which has challenged our civilisation. We are ready to cooperate in promoting human rights, global and regional stability and sustainable development.”

Mr Putin observed that the two countries had always been able to reach an understanding, not because many Russian and Sanskrit words had common roots but because national characters and perceptions of life, spirituality and culture of the two countries also had a lot in common.

Without naming Pakistan, President Kalam said, “Two years ago, on your previous visit to India, you had referred to the ‘arc of instability’ stretching from the Caucasus to South East Asia. The epicentre of this arc is of course, our common neighbourhood

The traditional rivalry between two of India’s largest industry associations — the CII and FICCI — was relegated to the background as both the chambers joined hands to organise a special luncheon session for Russian premier Vladimir Putin.

External Affairs Minister Yashwant Sinha, who has interacted with both the business chambers from close quarters during his earlier avtaar as Finance Minister, is well aware of the games of oneupmanship played by the CII and FICCI. Little wonder that a pleasantly surprised Sinha observed that Mr Putin did something which the Indian Government had so far been unsuccessful at — bringing the CII and FICCI together on the same platform.

Late arrival

Perhaps for the first time, the customary ceremonial welcome to a foreign Head of State, commenced behind schedule as Putin arrived about 15 minutes late. While the reason behind Mr Putin’s late arrival is not known, it put to test the administrative skills of Indian officials. For one, it did send the military precision of the welcome ceremony into some kind of a tailspin. President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam and Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee stood in anticipation to meet the Russian first citizen. After several minutes, some red faced officials hurriedly organised two chairs beneath the canopy for Dr Kalam and Mr Vajpayee to sit — a rather late realisation considering the fact that Mr Vajpayee’s knees are not in the pink of their health.

Mr Putin’s tryst with keeping behind schedule did not end here as he arrived about 30 minutes late in the special luncheon meeting with Indian industry captains under the aegis of the CII and FICCI. “We had a long and frutiful discussion”, External Affairs Minister Yashwant Sinha said as he ushered in Mr Putin into the conference hall of the glittering Maurya Sheraton hotel.

Incidentally, it is learnt that Minister of Small Scale Industry Vasundhara Raje arrived a few minutes late at the airport as Mr Putin set foot in New Delhi, forcing one to wonder whether the Russian premier’s late arrival was a diplomatic tit-for-tat?

Dal Dera Ismail Khan

Putin and his wife were treated to Frontier culinary fare at a private dinner hosted by Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee tonight. The culinary fare had a diplomatic connotation too as the Putins were offered Dal Dera Ismail Khan which they liked, sources at the Prime Minister’s residence said. Incidentally, Dera Ismail Khan is the Pakistani place on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border which is infamous for drug smuggling and open arms bazaar.

Pro-Pakistan militant outfit Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT) today declared a four-day unilateral ceasefire in entire Jammu and Kashmir from the eve of Id-ul-Fitr.

“The outfit will not attack Indian forces throughout the length and breadth of Jammu and Kashmir as a goodwill gesture in view of Id-ul-Fitr,” LeT spokesman Abu Huzaifa told local news agency CNS in a faxed statement.

He said the ceasefire would come into effect a day ahead of Id and would continue till the third day of the Muslim festivities.

He said even political leaders who were on the hitlist of the outfit would be spared during the ceasefire.

The American Ambassador to India, Mr Robert Blackwill, today held a detailed discussion with Lt-Gen T.P.S. Brar, GOC, 16 Corps, on the security situation in the light of terrorist activities in the Jammu region, even as he chose not to meet APHC leaders.

General Brar briefed the American Ambassador on the activities of Pakistan-aided insurgents who were trying not only to destabilise peace, but also kick up communal turmoil in the Jammu region. This was clear from the recent attack on two temples.

Mr Blackwill was shown large quantities of weapons, ammunition and explosives which the Indian troops had recovered from militants during operations against them. He was shown weapons with Pakistani and Chinese markings.

The Ambassador, escorted by General Brar, had an aerial survey of the LoC and the international border. He was briefed on the routes that Pakistan-aided militants adopted while infiltrating into the Indian territory.

General Brar was assisted by several senior Army officers to explain to the American Ambassador the nature of support the militants continue to receive from agencies across the border.

Mr Blackwill was informed that since the support of local youth to terrorist activities had shrunk, Pakistani agencies now banked on foreign mercenaries. This was evident from the elimination rate of militants from Pakistan, PoK and Afghanistan.

He was told at least 80 per cent militants operating in the Jammu region were foreign mercenaries. Informed sources said Mr Blackwill expressed concern over cross-border terrorism and favoured a broad-based dialogue to end the menace.

Later, Mr Blackwill flew back to Delhi after completing his three-day official visit to Jammu and Kashmir where he spent most of his time with the Army. He met the Governor, Mr G.C. Saxena, Chief Minister Mufti Mohammed Sayeed, former Chief Minister Dr Farooq Abdullah and other prominent citizens, including senior journalists.

Reacting to the Ambassador’s visit, former Chairman of the APHC, Molvi Umar Farooq, said it was “unfortunate” that he had chosen not to meet separatist leaders.

However, the Chairman, Prof Abdul Ghani Bhat told The Tribune that “it is up to the Ambassador to choose with whom he would like to discuss the state’s affairs”.

Molvi Umar Farooq accused Mr Blackwill of “toeing a pro-India line” as evident from the latter’s statement on terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir.

Prof Bhat said the statement that in order to end terrorism in the world, it had to be first ended in Jammu and Kashmir, was not a deviation from the American policy on Kashmir. He explained the American stand was that “Kashmir being a dispute needs to be resolved through negotiations, keeping in view the wishes of all regions.”

At the same time, he seemed intrigued over Mr Blackwill’s concern over cross-border terrorism when he said “the American Ambassador had to keep the interests of the host country in mind.”

Prof Bhat said before giving a “lecture on terrorism, the USA has to identify who is a terrorist.

He said Mr Blackwill and the country he represented in India had to explain “who is a terrorist — Isreal, India, Pakistan, Russia in Chechnya or America in Iraq.","Indian leaders and Russian President Putin made substantial progress on key issues, emphasizing intelligence sharing on Al-Qaida, Taliban, and boosting military cooperation. Eight agreements were signed, focusing on strategic partnership and economic collaboration, not defense. Declarations urged Pakistan to eliminate terrorism infrastructure for peaceful dialogues. Putin supported India’s stance, urging Pakistan to halt terrorism infiltration and dismantle its terror networks.

Former India cricketer Harbhajan Singh has blamed “bad umpiring and rules” for Pakistan’s one-wicket defeat against South Africa in the World Cup match, urging the International Cricket Council (ICC) to change the rules, adding that ""this can happen to Indian team tomorrow"". He, however, was trolled on social media for supporting Pakistan.

South Africa on Friday registered a narrow win in a tense finish. It was their first World Cup win against Pakistan since 1999.The third-umpire decision had gone against Pakistan after the DRS showed the umpire’s call.

Tabraiz Shamsi was given not-out by the on-field umpire and the Pakistan opted for the Decision Review System.

However, they didn’t get the decision in their favour.

Backing Pakistan, Harbhajan wrote on X: “Bad umpiring and bad rules cost Pakistan this game.. @ICC should change this rule.. if the ball is hitting the stump that’s out whether umpire gave out or not out doesn’t matter..otherwise what is the use of technology??? @TheRealPCB vs #SouthAfrica #worldcup.”

NEW DELHI: Pakistan's team director, Mickey Arthur, expressed his disappointment with the team's performance in the World Cup and emphasized the need for a perfect game where all departments collectively contribute following their narrow loss to South Africa.
In the match held at the MA Chidambaram Stadium, Pakistan posted a below-par total of 270 runs. However, they made a valiant effort through their bowlers, only to lose the thrilling contest by one wicket.
Arthur candidly admitted, ""Look, to be brutally honest, we haven't put together the perfect game yet. I don't think we've batted well enough yet as a unit. I think that pitch, certainly par on that pitch is 300 at least. We haven't put together enough runs.""

— TheRealPCB (@TheRealPCB)

He also pointed out the inconsistency in their performance, stating, ""And then we haven't put together a bowling performance that goes with it. Tonight I thought was our best bowling performance of the competition. We bowled really well, but I still thought we were under par in terms of the runs that we had.""
Arthur recognized that the team's struggle is not due to a lack of effort but rather the lack of players in form, especially with the bat.

Following Pakistan's fourth successive defeat in the tournament after two early wins, their chances of advancing to the knockout stages looked bleak. However, Arthur expressed determination and a commitment to making improvements.

— cricketworldcup (@cricketworldcup)

He mentioned, ""You never know. What I do know is we need to go and assess combinations again, we need to have a look at the holes we have within our team.""

With matches against Bangladesh, New Zealand, and England on the horizon, Arthur highlighted the team's resolve, saying, ""We need to start improving in a lot of areas, and we've got to go and finish this tournament with three victories. Every day we'll be trying and striving to do that.""

NEW DELHI: Babar Azam's tenure as the captain of the Pakistan cricket team might be in jeopardy as former Pakistani wicketkeeper Rashid Latif, who is known for fueling conspiracy theories, alleged on Saturday that Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chief Zaka Ashraf has been unresponsive to Babar's calls and text messages.
Pakistan faced their fourth consecutive defeat, a closely contested one-wicket loss to South Africa, effectively sealing their probable elimination from the World Cup. Emotions in the country have been running high, with former players openly demanding a change in leadership at the helm of the team.
""I know for a fact that Babar has got no response from the Chairman (Zaka Ashraf) when he called and messaged from India,"" Latif claimed on the state-owned PTV sports channel.
Latif also claimed that players have pending salaries from their central contracts, amounting to at least four to five months' worth.

— imransiddique89 (@imransiddique89)

""The players have not got salaries..the Chairman is not responding to the captain and in these circumstances what do we expect from the team.""

Latif also claimed that some senior officials in the board had now conveyed to the players the central contracts they signed before leaving for the World Cup were under review now.

Latif, who was one of the original whistle-blowers during the infamous match-fixing saga claimed that a lobby that wanted Babar to endorse surrogate betting advertisements are rooting for his ouster although he didn't give any proof to substantiate his claims.

""You have to see who are the people who have been hit by this ban on surrogate advertising. Babar is being punished for his bold and principled stand on surrogate advertising before the World Cup,"" Latif said.

Akram, Malik critcise Babar's captaincy acumen

Legendary Wasim Akram was at his wits' end to understand why Babar gave that 48th over to left-arm spinner Mohammed Nawaz, who isn't known to be consistent.


""I don't know what he (Babar) was doing? Why give Nawaz the over when he had not bowled well at all in the innings and was lacking confidence? Usama was the obvious choice with the fast bowlers having finished their spells. Poor captaincy,"" Akram said on 'The Pavilion'.


On the same show, Malik, who is a known Babar critic was more blunt.

""I have always said that Babar is not made for captaincy. He can't handle the pressure and it is affecting his batting badly,"" Malik said.

NEW DELHI: India and England have adopted significantly different strategies, resulting in divergent outcomes in the ongoing World Cup, and this trend is expected to continue in their upcoming clash on Sunday.
India, led by Rohit Sharma, has been performing remarkably well, successfully chasing down their targets in five consecutive games. Their consistent performance has put them on a path to topping the league stage.
In contrast, England, who had set the benchmark in white-ball cricket with their aggressive style of play, find themselves struggling in Indian conditions. The approach that led them to global triumphs in shorter formats has proven less effective in the subcontinent. As defending champions, England now face the possibility of an early exit from the tournament.
The clash between India and England is anticipated to be a critical match that may determine the fate of both teams in the World Cup.
Ashwin or Shami or Siraj?


Team India faces a selection dilemma. While India are in a relatively comfortable position in the tournament, they will have to manage without the all-round services of Hardik Pandya for at least the next couple of games.

In typical circumstances, Ravichandran Ashwin would have been the natural replacement for Shardul Thakur on a pitch that is expected to favour spinners. However, Hardik's absence presents a challenge for the team management, as they will be limited to fielding only five bowlers.

The lineup for Sunday's game is expected to include Jasprit Bumrah, Kuldeep Yadav, and Ravindra Jadeja. To incorporate Ashwin as the third spinner, Team India faces a decision between Mohammad Siraj and Mohammed Shami, who demonstrated his world-class capabilities with a five-wicket performance in Dharamsala. The choice between these two proven performers presents a significant and challenging decision for the team management.
Opportunity for SKY and Shreyas

India's performance has showcased a template that rival teams may look to emulate. With aggressive stroke play in the powerplay, Indian batters have mastered the art of chasing, whether they are cruising to victory or facing high-pressure situations, as they did against Australia.

In the absence of Hardik, Suryakumar Yadav has taken on the role at number six for the team. Although he experienced an unfortunate run-out in his first game of the competition, Yadav, known for his X-factor, will be eager to make a significant impact.
The discussion around Shreyas Iyer's struggles against short-pitched deliveries has resurfaced following his dismissal in Dharamsala. Iyer will be motivated to silence his critics and prove his mettle in the upcoming matches.

Shubman Gill, who missed the first couple of games due to dengue, is poised for a standout performance, and fans in Lucknow might witness Virat Kohli's 49th century, potentially equaling a historic record.

Local wrist spinner Kuldeep Yadav, hailing from Uttar Pradesh, is ready to challenge England's batters at the state-of-the-art stadium. His recent test against Daryl Mitchell will have prepared him for the England challenge, and he is eager to showcase his skills in front of his home crowd.



Will England change their approach?

England boast a formidable lineup of batting firepower with the likes of Jos Buttler, Jonny Bairstow, Ben Stokes, Liam Livingstone, and Harry Brook. Despite their reputation, they have faced challenges, especially in conditions that should be familiar to them.

While aggressive play from the very beginning is a necessity in T20 cricket, the demands of the ODI format require a different approach. England's batters must adapt to the conditions and adjust their style of play accordingly.

On the Lucknow pitch, which may not favour power-hitting, they will need to show more patience and gauge the conditions better. Joe Root stands out as a batsman with different gears, and others in the team should follow his example.
England's bowling department has also faced its share of concerns, with star pacer Reece Topley ruled out of the tournament due to injury, with Brydon Carse replacing him. Mark Wood, considered one of the key pacers, is yet to hit top form and will be seeking a turnaround.

However, England's spin combination of Moeen Ali and Adil Rashid could pose a threat to the in-form Indian batters.

The atmosphere at the 50,000 capacity stadium in Lucknow is expected to be electric, with passionate fans cheering on the home team in what promises to be a thrilling clash in the World Cup.
quads:

England: Jos Buttler (c), Moeen Ali, Gus Atkinson, Jonny Bairstow, Sam Curran, Liam Livingstone, Dawid Malan, Adil Rashid, Joe Root, Harry Brook, Ben Stokes, Brydon Carse, David Willey, Mark Wood, Chris Woakes.


India: Rohit Sharma (c), Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul, Ravindra Jadeja, Shardul Thakur, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj, Kuldeep Yadav, Mohammed Shami, Ravichandran Ashwin, Ishan Kishan, Suryakumar Yadav and Hardik Pandya.

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistani fast bowler Umar Gul strongly criticised all-rounder Shadab Khan for leaving the field during a pivotal moment in the team's World Cup match against South Africa in Chennai.
Pakistan faced their fourth consecutive defeat on Friday, effectively diminishing their chances of progressing further in the tournament.
""I don't think Shadab had a serious injury. When one or two wickets were left, he came out on camera to cheer and clap for the team. It just means that you are playing with the emotions of 24 crore Pakistani people. It is not funny,"" Umar said on a TV channel.
During the South African innings, Shadab experienced a head injury when he dived to prevent a ball. He briefly left the field but later made a comeback. However, he was subsequently replaced in the game by Usama Mir as a concussion substitute.
Umar expressed doubt regarding the severity of the concussion injury Shadab sustained while fielding at mid-off, indicating that he didn't think it warranted him leaving the field.


""He went off and after a while came back. His scans were apparently also clear. I think he took a route to escape from the pressure and action on the field,"" the former pacer alleged.

Mir finished with two wickets in a thrilling match that SA won by one wicket and effectively ended Pakistan's chances of qualifying for the semi-finals.

Another former Test pacer, Sohail Tanvir noted that the crowd in Chennai was very sporting and appreciated the Pakistan team's good performances.

Tanveer also backed the allegation by Gul, but he was more careful with his words.


""We don't know how serious this concussion injury was but the way Shadab first returned to the field then went back on whoever's advice... His presence in the dugout does make one wonder should he not have carried on playing.

""I know of players who have batted with broken hands and arms because it was necessary for the team,"" Umar added.

The Maharashtra government is facing a major crisis after Eknath Shinde, a senior Shiv Sena leader, rebelled against the party and took away with him 30 MLAs. Shinde is currently camping in Guwahati with the MLAs.

Shinde has accused the Shiv Sena leadership of sidelining him and his supporters. He has also said that he will not return to the party fold unless the leadership is willing to listen to his demands.

The Shiv Sena leadership has dismissed Shinde's rebellion as ""an internal matter"". However, the crisis has put the Maharashtra government in a precarious position.

If the Shinde faction is able to prove that it has the support of more than two-thirds of the Shiv Sena MLAs, then it can stake claim to form the government in Maharashtra.

The BJP, which is the main opposition party in Maharashtra, has said that it is willing to support Shinde if he is able to prove his majority in the assembly.

The crisis in Maharashtra has the potential to destabilize the government and lead to fresh elections in the state.

The Maharashtra government plunged into crisis on Tuesday morning after simmering discontent within the Shiv Sena boiled over and a senior minister and around 30 legislators from the party moved to a resort in neighboring Gujarat, in a precursor to a possible split in the party and a threat to the survival of the ruling coalition.

Urban development minister Eknath Shinde left Mumbai on Monday night, shortly after voting ended in the legislative council polls, where the ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) suffered an embarrassing defeat as 12 members of the Sena appeared to cross-vote in favor of a Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) candidate. This was the second defeat of the alliance after the shock loss of its candidate in the Rajya Sabha polls.

Shinde’s move, people familiar with the matter said, seems to have been driven more by internal Sena factors — chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s illness and relative isolation; and the growing prominence of Sanjay Raut and Aaditya Thackeray — than by external ones, such as the BJP’s influence, which has typically been the case in other states that have seen similar situations (Karnataka in 2018; Madhya Pradesh in 2020).

Shinde said he would never “cheat for power” but later in the day, appeared to have rebuffed overtures from two Thackeray emissaries who flew to Surat to speak to him. Thackeray and Shinde spoke on the phone for 10 minutes, but it wasn’t clear whether any understanding was reached, said a Sena functionary.

“We are staunch Shiv Sainiks of Balasaheb who gave us lessons on Hindutva. We will never cheat for power and will never abandon the teachings of Balasaheb and Anand Dighe for power,” Shinde tweeted in Marathi.

Sena leaders aware of developments said the 58-year-old leader wanted to have an alliance between Sena and the BJP on the Hindutva agenda. But the party said it does not work with “conditions”, added the leaders. “He (Shinde) said that his demand was Sena-BJP alliance. He alleged NCP was finishing off Sena in the state. Shinde seemed adamant on his demand,” said a party functionary, who asked not to be named.

There are 288 members in the state assembly, of which one seat is vacant. The Shiv Sena has 55 members, the Nationalist Congress Party 53, and the Congress 44. They have the support of three smaller parties and nine independent members. Together, the MVA has 166 members. The BJP has 106 lawmakers. It is backed by two smaller parties and four independents. Together, its strength is 112.

Outside these two formations, there are nine lawmakers across six parties.

With around 30legislators, the Shinde faction is well short of the 37 needed to meet the criterion set by the anti-defection law. That could mean their disqualification, which will make it easy for the MVA to pass a floor test.

Sena spokesperson Sanjay Raut said the BJP was trying to pull down the MVA government, but the conspiracy won’t succeed. “The Sena MLAs are being kept under the watch of the Gujarat police (where the BJP is in power). Some of the MLAs have said that their lives are in danger,” he said.

In the meeting of party legislators on Tuesday morning, a resolution was proposed and passed to remove Shinde as the group leader in the legislature, to not give him any powers over the party legislators. Raut announced the move to replace Shinde with Sewri legislator Ajay Chaudhary on Tuesday afternoon. The meeting was attended by 18 members, said a Sena insider,but Raut insisted that 33 were present.

The BJP , which, with its allies, has 112 seats in the house right now, is unlikely to muster the strength to form a government – a situation that is unlikely to change even if it manages to win around 30 seats vacant (on account of the disqualifications) when the by-election is held, although the situation could change if it can get more legislators from the MVA to resign.

Soon after Shidne’s move, the BJP’s Devendra fadnavis flew to Delhi for meetings with the party’s central leadership.

“We are a political party and if somebody comes with a proposal we will surely consider it in the interest of the people of Maharashtra,” said state BJP chief Chandrakant Patil.

The focus now shifts to the other parties in the MVA — the Congress and the NCP — and their ability to keep their flock together; NCP chief Sharad Pawar met CM Thackeray late on Tuesday.

Cabinet ministers Balasaheb Thorat and Ashok Chavan of the Congress met Thackeray at his official residence in the evening where state NCP president and minister Jayant Patil was also present.

In an afternoon press conference, Pawar expressed confidence in the Sena’s ability to deal with an internal crisis. “Eknath Shinde never told us about his CM ambitions; I am sure Uddhav Thackeray will handle situation,” he said.

In a bid to placate Shinde, Sena chief and chief minister Uddhav Thackeray sent his close aide Milind Narvekar and legislator Ravindra Phatak to Surat. However, the Sena minister did not budge from his decision and questioned the party’s decision to remove him from the post of the group leader.

Narvekar and Phatak had a 40-minute discussion with Shinde at the hotel, a person familiar with the matter said. Shinde and Uddhav Thackeray spoke over the phone but no pact was reached after Shinde demanded the restoration of the BJP-Sena alliance, which broke after the 2019 elections when the BJP refused to cede the chief minister’s position to the Sena.

“Eknath Shinde’s stand about an alliance with BJP came out of nowhere today. Milind Narvekar and [Ravindra] Phatak went to Surat to meet him. Shiv Sena is a party that does not work when conditions are put. The alliance of 25 years had to be cut off due to certain reasons. Everyone, including Eknath Shinde, is aware of why Shiv Sena split with the BJP. How Shiv Sena was insulted at every step. We are trying to hold talks. We are prepared to face any situation and we are trying to fight it out,” said Raut.

The Sena has faced similar crises in the past — in 1991, senior leader Chhagan Bhujbal, who was upset at not being appointed the leader of opposition quit, and in 2005, leader of opposition Narayan Rane and Raj Thackeray left.

Analysts said it was possible the BJP could push for President’s Rule in the state. For this to happen, Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari would have to recommend central rule in the state if a constitutional crisis persists.

For the BJP to gain a majority in the House, Shinde would have to garner enough lawmakers to evade the anti-defection law, legally break away from the Sena and back the BJP. The state also doesn’t have a full-time speaker, with Narhari Zirwal from the NCP currently the acting speaker.

The crisis in the Sena has been in the making for several months now, after Thackeray’s illness last year pushed him into near-complete isolation. Party insiders say Shinde, 58, who has been with the Sena for three decades felt slighted at the importance being assigned to MP Sanjay Raut and Thackeray’s son Aaditya.

The MVA came together as an ideologically disparate coalition in 2019 after the Sena broke ties with the BJP and NCP chief Sharad Pawar stitched together an alliance. It won a convincing majority in a floor test but has since been embattled by a number of corruption scandals, senior ministers jailed on graft charges and recent electoral losses.

For 31months now, the MVA has managed to balance the interests of three parties with widely differing agendas, but as evident during the Rajya Sabha polls in which the second candidate of the Shiv Sena lost, it is not an alliance that can swing things in its favor – at least not all the time.

People familiar with the matter said that the MVA struggled to square the interests and agendas of three parties that either have an overlapping or an inimical socio-political base, is a coalition of extremes, and has elected representatives and leaders competing with each other at the local level.

There are around 68 constituencies where the BJP has little or no presence, but the Sena, NCP or Congress are at odds.","The Maharashtra government faces a political crisis as senior Shiv Sena minister Eknath Shinde and approximately 30 legislators from the party have moved to a resort in Gujarat, potentially signaling a rift within the party and posing a threat to the ruling coalition's stability. Shinde's departure followed a legislative council poll in which several Sena members appeared to vote for a BJP candidate. This internal discord seems driven by factors within the Shiv Sena, including Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray's illness, the growing influence of Sanjay Raut and Aaditya Thackeray, and Shinde's desire for a Sena-BJP alliance on the Hindutva agenda, which the party rejected. While the BJP could benefit from the situation, it currently lacks the numbers to form a government. The crisis underscores the challenges of managing a coalition with varying interests and agendas. President's Rule or further developments may follow.
