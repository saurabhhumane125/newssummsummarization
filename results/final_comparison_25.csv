Delhi's air quality was recorded in the 'poor' category for the fourth consecutive day on Thursday and any improvement is unlikely soon, according to monitoring agencies.

The city's 24-hour average Air Quality Index (AQI) stood at 256 at 4 pm, worsening from 243 on Wednesday and 220 on Tuesday.

The average AQI was 235 in neighbouring Ghaziabad, 254 in Faridabad, 230 in Gurugram, 191 in Noida and 260 in Greater Noida.

According to the Centre's Air Quality Early Warning System for Delhi, the city's air quality is likely to oscillate between the 'poor' and 'very poor' categories over the next three to four days.

An AQI between zero and 50 is considered 'good', 51 and 100 'satisfactory', 101 and 200 'moderate', 201 and 300 'poor', 301 and 400 'very poor', and 401 and 500 'severe'.

The government also launched a campaign to curb vehicular pollution on Thursday, a year after Lieutenant Governor V K Saxena put it on hold, questioning its effectiveness.

A 2019 study conducted by the Central Road Research Institute showed that keeping engines running at traffic signals can increase pollution levels by more than 9 per cent.

A range of emission inventory and source apportionment studies carried out for Delhi in the past few years suggested that on-road vehicular exhaust emissions account for 9 per cent to 38 per cent of PM2.5 emissions in the capital.

Delhi's air quality had turned 'very poor' on Sunday for the first time since May, mainly due to a drop in temperature and wind speed, which allowed pollutants to accumulate.

Unfavourable meteorological conditions and a cocktail of emissions from firecrackers and paddy straw burning, in addition to local sources of pollution, push Delhi-NCR's air quality to hazardous levels around Diwali every year.

According to an analysis conducted by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee, the capital experiences peak pollution from November 1 to November 15, when stubble burning incidents in Punjab and Haryana peak.

Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai said the government has identified eight more pollution hotspots in addition to the existing 13 in the national capital, and special teams will be deployed there to check pollution sources.

Rai said the government has also decided to use suppressant powder to prevent dust pollution in the city.

Dust suppressants could include chemical agents like calcium chloride, magnesium chloride, lignosulfonates and various polymers. These chemicals work by attracting and binding fine dust particles together, making them too heavy to become airborne.

The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM), a statutory body responsible for proactively implementing the pollution control plan known as the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), had on Saturday directed authorities in the NCR to increase parking fees to discourage private transport and enhance the services of CNG or electric buses and metro trains amid a likely increase in pollution levels.

This action is part of Stage II of GRAP which is implemented when Delhi's AQI is predicted to turn 'very poor'.

GRAP categorises actions into four stages: Stage I 'poor' (AQI 201-300); Stage II 'very poor' (AQI 301-400); Stage III 'severe' (AQI 401-450); and Stage IV 'severe plus' (AQI >450).

The Delhi government had last month launched a 15-point action plan to mitigate air pollution in the capital during the winter season, with a strong emphasis on addressing dust pollution, vehicular emissions and open burning of garbage.

Thousands of people watched the famous Ravan Dahan event at Central Sports Grounds in Banaras Locomotive Works (BLW) on Tuesday evening as this year the Dussehra festival was celebrated with great pomp and its traditional fervour. In the recent decades, the event has become very popular as a huge number of people turned out there. When the effigies of ‘Demon King’ Ravana, his brother Kumbhakaran and son Meghnad which were 75, 70 and 65 feet high respectively were burnt, the mood of the people turned electrified and the slogans of ‘Jai Siya Ram’ echoed the atmosphere. The grounds as well as roads in its surrounding areas were packed with thousands of people. A large number of firecrackers were set in all the three effigies.

The event marked the triumph of good over evil and prior to that, the artistes performed Ramlila. The audience was mesmerised by the dialogue of Angad and Ravana and wars between Lord Ram and Ravana as well as Lakshman and Meghnath. After defeating Ravana by Lord Ram, the event of burning of effigies began. Prior to effigy burning, the firecrackers were lit, changing the mood of the people. Earlier, the Principal Chief Electrical Engineer (PCEE) SK Srivastava performed the aarti of Lord Ram and Mata Sita. Then the artistes performed Lila of Ram Van Gaman to Ravana Vadh based on Ramcharitmanas. The Lila performed by the students of BLW Inter College for two-and-a-half hours was highly appreciated.

There was a ban on carrying bags, tiffins, water bottles and any kind of inflammable material in the fair premises. Even after 12 noon, all types of vehicles including two wheelers were stopped from entering the Mela areas. General Manager Basudev Panda constantly instructed the officials to make the Vijayadashami fair well organised. District administration, Uttar Pradesh Police, Railway Protection Force, St John’s Ambulance Brigade, Civil Defence, District Scouts and Guides and members of Vijayadashami Committee played an important role in conducting the fair smoothly and peacefully. To deal with any untoward incident, the medical team of BLW Central Hospital was present there, setting up its first aid posts there.

   The Ravana Dahan event of BLW is unique in itself as it is an example of Ganga-Yamuni (harmonious) culture. The effigies of Ravana, Kumbhakaran and Meghnad are made by Shamshad Khan and his family, who have been residents of Kashi for three generations and Angad was portrayed by Sohrab Hussain in this unique Ramlila.

The function was also attended by Principal Chief Engineer Vinod Bampal, Principal Chief Personnel Officer Ranvijay, Chief Mechanical Engineer (SE) Neeraj Jain, Chief Materials Manager (Loco) Trilok Kothari, Chief Materials Manager (Headquarters) SK Mishra, Senior Deputy General Manager Vijay, Chief Engineer Vinod Kumar Shukla, Chief Electrical Engineer (Inspection) MK Singh, Chief Mechanical Engineer (QMS) Ramjanam Choubey, Public Relations Officer Rajesh Kumar and a large number of BLW officers and employees.

In the end, the vote of thanks was given by the convener of Vijayadashami Samiti MP Singh, Deputy Chief Mechanical Engineer (Spare).","The famous Ravan Dahan event at Central Sports Grounds in Banaras Locomotive Works (BLW) marked a grand celebration of Dussehra, drawing thousands of spectators.

A day after US President Joe Biden, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak landed in war-torn Israel on Thursday. Rishi Sunak said that Britain would stand by Israel in ""its darkest hour"". Meanwhile, the Australian government today accused Israel of collectively punishing Palestinians in its war on Hamas.

On Wednesday, hours after a blast at a hospital in Gaza killed hundreds, Israel said that it would allow Egypt to deliver limited humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip. Assessing the explosion, the White House said the Gaza hospital explosion appeared to be the result of an errant rocket fired by a terrorist group in Gaza.

There were conflicting claims about who was behind the explosion on Tuesday night, but protests flared quickly in the region as many Arab leaders said Israel was responsible. Hamas officials in Gaza quickly blamed an Israeli airstrike, saying hundreds were killed. Israel denied it was involved and released a flurry of video, audio and other information that it said showed the blast was instead due to a rocket misfire by Islamic Jihad, another terrorist group operating in Gaza. Islamic Jihad dismissed that claim.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR | TOP DEVELOPMENTS
British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak met his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday. Rishi Sunak assured that Britain would stand by Israel in ""its darkest hour"".


""I know that you are taking every precaution to avoid harming civilians in direct contrast to the terrorists of Hamas which seeks to put civilians in harm's way,"" Rishi Sunak said alongside Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem. ""I welcome your decision yesterday that you took to ensure that routes into Gaza will be opened for humanitarian aid to enter ... I'm proud to stand here with you. In Israel's darkest hour as your friend. We will stand with you in solidarity. We will stand with your people and we also want you to win.""

Benjamin Netanyahu told Rishi Sunak that the October 7 attack by Hamas terrorists was aimed to prevent the expansion of its peaceful relations in the Middle East. ""We were on the cusp of expanding that peace, and destroying that move was one of the reasons why this action was taken,"" he said.

""This is our darkest hour,"" Netanyahu added. ""That means that this is a long war, and we'll need your continuous support.""

The Australian government has accused Israel of collectively punishing Palestinians in its war on Hamas.

""I feel very strongly that Palestinians are being collectively punished here for Hamas’ barbarism. I really do feel there is an obligation on governments, particularly the Israeli government, to follow the rules of international law and to observe in particular that innocents should be protected,"" the Associated Press quoted Australian government minister Ed Husic as saying.

In his first comments on the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, Chinese President Xi Jinping said his country wants the war to be stopped as soon as possible.

""China wants the Israel-Hamas war to be stopped as soon as possible. Beijing was willing to work with Arab governments for a lasting solution to the conflict. A ceasefire was ""imperative"" as soon as possible to prevent the conflict from expanding, or spiralling out of control.""

President Joe Biden, who swept into wartime Israel for a seven-and-a-half-hour visit on Wednesday, wrapped up his stay in Tel Aviv.

Likening the October 7 Hamas assault to the attacks against the United States on September 11, 2001, that killed nearly 3,000 people, Biden said, ""I understand. Many Americans understand. You can't look at what has happened here and not scream out for justice. But I caution this: While you feel that rage, don't be consumed by it. After 9/11, we were enraged in the United States. And while we sought justice and got justice, we also made mistakes.""

As the United States concluded Israel was not responsible for the Gaza hospital bombing, Biden also said, ""I'm not suggesting Hamas deliberately bombed the Gaza hospital.""

The digital age amplifies voices, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent posts on X (formerly Twitter) condemning the Hamas attacks on Israel have certainly not gone unnoticed. Whilst there has been uproar and viral retweets across the Arab world, the absence of India's reaffirmation on the Israel-Palestine two-state solution at the leadership level is stark.

Hasan Alhasan, a Middle East expert at IISS, told India Today, ""The Indian Prime Minister, within a few hours of the Hamas attack took a very partisan, very clear stance on Twitter by tweeting that India stood in solidarity with Israel."" He went on to mention the potential fallout from this stance, pointing out that ""India has associated its own reputation now with the Israeli response.""
For instance, a tweet/X post points to a specific perspective, amplifying the sentiment felt by many in the Arab world. Abdul Khaled Abdulla, a professor of political science posted, “The Indian position was in solidarity with the Palestinian cause for a long time, and then there was a gradual shift towards recognizing Israel and deepening strategic relations with it. Today, it has become completely identified with Israel, and has even begun to align itself with it to the point of declaring support for its aggression against Gaza.”

Furthermore, the position that the Arab world sees India take could have ramifications for the massive Indian diaspora living in the Middle East or West Asia. Alhasan raised concerns about communal tensions escalating if India's domestic politics spilled into the diaspora in the Gulf. He recalled the rise in anti-Muslim sentiments in 2020 by the Indian far-right that affected NRIs (Non-Resident Indians) in the Gulf.

Israeli airstrikes pounded locations across the Gaza Strip early Thursday, including parts of the south that Israel had declared as safe zones, heightening fears among more than 2 million Palestinians trapped in the territory that nowhere was safe.

In the nearly two weeks since a devastating Hamas rampage in southern Israel, the Israeli military has relentlessly attacked Gaza in response. Even after Israel told Palestinians to evacuate the north and head to what it called “safe zones” in the south, strikes continued overnight throughout the densely populated territory.

A residential building in Khan Younis, a city in southern Gaza where hundreds of thousands of Palestinians had fought shelter, was among the places hit. Medical personnel at Nasser Hospital said they received at least 12 dead and 40 wounded.

The bombardments came after Israel agreed Wednesday to allow Egypt to deliver limited humanitarian aid to Gaza, the first crack in a punishing 11-day siege. Many among Gaza’s 2.3 million residents have cut down to one meal a day and resorted to drinking dirty water.

The announcement of a plan to bring water, food and other supplies into Gaza came as fury over a Tuesday night explosion at Gaza City’s al-Ahli Hospital spread across the Middle East. There were conflicting claims of who was behind the blast, which the Hamas-run Health Authority said had killed hundreds of Palestinians.

Hamas officials in Gaza blamed an Israeli airstrike, saying hundreds were killed. Israel denied it was involved and released a flurry of video, audio and other information that it said showed the blast was instead due to a rocket misfire by Islamic Jihad, another militant group operating in Gaza. Islamic Jihad dismissed the Israeli claim.

The Associated Press has not independently verified any of the claims or evidence.

US President Joe Biden, who visited Israel on Wednesday, said data from his Defense Department showed the explosion was not likely caused by an Israeli airstrike. The White House later said an analysis of “overhead imagery, intercepts and open-source information” showed Israel was not behind the attack. But the US continues to collect evidence.

Video from the scene showed the hospital grounds strewn with torn bodies, many of them young children. Hundreds of wounded were rushed to Gaza City’s main hospital, where doctors already facing critical supply shortages were sometimes forced to perform surgery on the floors, often without anesthesia.

More than 1 million Palestinians, roughly half of Gaza’s population, have fled their homes in Gaza City and other places in the northern part of the territory since Israel told them to evacuate. Most have crowded into U.N.-run school shelters or the homes of relatives.

Hundreds of people are feared dead after an explosion at a hospital in the Gaza Strip on the fateful night of October 17, little over a week after the Palestinian group Hamas staged a terrorist attack on Israel that killed 1,400 people and led Israel to declare war.

The devastating impact of an explosion at the Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City on Tuesday became clearer only after the satellite images and videos were posted online.

The Hamas, which currently controls Gaza, attributed the blast to an Israeli airstrike. In contrast, Israel claimed it was caused by an errant rocket fired by another armed group, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which denied the accusation. On Wednesday, President Biden supported Israel's position, citing ""the data I was shown by my Defense Department.""

Online images and videos present varying narratives of the same event. Nonetheless, by examining post-strike images and utilising satellite imagery from Maxar Technologies, it is possible to construct an accurate depiction of the incident and map the extent of the damage caused by the strike.

As the war between Israel and Hamas rages on, pro-Palestinian demonstrators flooded streets across the US and Europe in solidarity with Palestinians and demanding an end to Israeli military action in Hamas-controlled Gaza.

The Israel-Hamas war has spilled onto the streets of the US and Europe in the form of protests. Pro-Palestinian demonstrations are being held in several countries across the world, seeking an end to the Israel-Hamas war that broke out on October 7 after terror attacks in Israel.

The protesters have been demanding an end to the violence in Gaza, resulting from Israeli counterattacks, and expressed solidarity with the Palestinian people.

The Akhil Bhartiya Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram has urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to commemorate the 100th birth anniversary of veteran tribal leader Kartik Oraon with the release of a special coin and a postal stamp in his honour.

 In a letter to the prime minister last week, the organisation's president Ramchandra Kharadi also proposed that Oraon's 100th birth anniversary be celebrated nationally ""as a day of remembrance and tribute to his remarkable life and services"".

 This national celebration would be a ""fitting recognition"" of Oraon's legacy and the values he stood for, Kharadi said, adding that this will also help in ""mitigating a sense of alienation and unrest among a section of Scheduled Tribes (STs), particularly the youths"".

 The Akhil Bhartiya Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram is an affiliate of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the ideological fountainhead of the Bharatiya Janata Party ruling at the Centre.

 ""His (Kartik Oraon's) life and contributions are a source of inspiration not only for Janjatis (tribals) but for all the people across India. His legacy extends beyond political achievements and encapsulates a commitment to the welfare and empowerment of marginalised communities, particularly Janjatis,"" the letter read.

 Oraon, also popularly known as Baba Kartik Saheb, was born on October 29, 1924 at Karounda Littatoli in Gumla district of the erstwhile state of Bihar (now Jharkhand) and passed away on December 8, 1981.

 ""In light of the 100th birth anniversary of Kartik Oraon, Akhil Bhartiya Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram respectfully requests the government of India to consider commemorating this occasion with a special coin and a postal stamp in his honor,"" Kharadi said in the letter.

 ""Such a tribute would not only acknowledge his significant contributions but also serve as an enduring symbol of inspiration for generations to come, particularly the Janjatis,"" he added.

NEW DELHI: The central government has asked states that they have no power to impose any tax or duty on electricity generated from any source - coal, hydro, wind or solar and any such levy is illegal and unconstitutional. In a circular, the Union Ministry of Power on October 25, said it had come to the notice of the central government that some state governments had imposed additional charges on generation of electricity from various sources under the guise of development free/charges/fund.
""Such additional charges/fees in the form of any tax/duty on the generation of electricity, which encompasses all types of generation viz thermal, hydro, wind, solar, nuclear etc is illegal and unconstitutional,"" it said.
Clarifying the constitutional position, the ministry said the powers to levy taxes/duties are specifically stated in the VII Schedule.
""List-II of the VII Schedule lists the powers of levying taxes/duties by the states in entries 45 to 63. No taxes/duties which have not been specifically mentioned in this list can be levied by the state governments under any guise whatsoever - as residuary powers are with the central government,"" it said.

Entry 53 of the List-II (State List) authorises the states to levy taxes on the consumption or sale of electricity in its jurisdiction.
""This does not include the power to impose any tax or duty on the generation of electricity. This is because electricity generated within the territory of one state may be consumed in other states and no state has the power to levy taxes/duties on residents of other states,"" the order said.

The ministry went on to state that Article 286 of the Constitution explicitly prohibits states from imposing any taxes/duties on the supply of goods or services or on both, where the supply takes place outside the state.
Also, Articles 287 and 288 prohibit the imposition of taxes on the consumption or sale of electricity consumed by the Central government or sold to the Central government for consumption by the government or its agencies.

""In light of the constitutional provisions, no taxes/duties can be levied by any state on generation or inter-state supply of electricity under the guise of additional charges/free on generation of electricity from any source - thermal, hydro or renewables,"" the orders said.

The Central government asked states to promptly remove any kind of tax/duty/cess levied in the guise of development free/charges/fund on generation or electricity from any sources.

In April, the Ministry had asked states not to levy or impose any tax or duty on the generation of electricity, especially from hydro projects.

""Some states have imposed taxes/duties on the generation of electricity under the guise of levying a cess on the use of water for generating electricity.


""However, though the state may call it a water cess, it is actually a tax on the generation of electricity - the tax is to be collected from the consumers of electricity who may happen to be residents in other states,"" the power ministry had said on April 25.

Any imposition of tax on the non-consumptive use of water of these rivers for electricity generation is in violation of provisions of the Constitution, it argued.


Stating that most of the hydroelectric plants in the states are located on inter-state rivers, the ministry had stated that hydropower projects do not consume water to produce electricity. Electricity is generated by directing the flow of water through a turbine which generates electricity - on the same principle as electricity from wind projects where wind is utilized to turn the turbine to produce electricity.


Therefore, the ministry had said that there is no rationale for the levy of water cess or air cess.

Mumbai: As India approaches the May 3 deadline for lifting the nationwide lockdown, top epidemiologists are divided over the future course of Covid-19 management and the strategy to be followed in getting the country back to work.
Two veteran infectious diseases experts — Jayaprakash Muliyal and T Jacob John, who were at the forefront of the leprosy eradication and pulse polio immunisation programmes, respectively — feel it’s time to end the lockdown, with one of them describing a long-term shutdown as akin to ‘burning the house to kill a rat’.
Experts from the official health establishment, however, advocate phased relief, with strict containment measures guided by surveillance mechanisms. They warn that achieving ‘herd immunity’ is a costly proposition that will result in a surge of positive cases, which will overwhelm the healthcare system.My advice is: Keep the elderly out of the picture for the time being, as the disease hurts them the most. So, we quarantine the old for two-three months and let the youngsters get to work,” Muliyal told ET.
“Several of them will fall ill, unfortunately, but there will be adequate space in hospitals to treat them. So, mortality can be further reduced. And then, we reach the point of saturation, or herd immunity,” he added.
Act of Stopping Time: T Jacob John
Muliyal has been a big proponent of the ‘herd immunity’ concept. This is a strategy where you let natural immunisation take place by a large population contracting the disease, thereby halting the spread of the infection.
This controversial concept was initially promoted by UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, before the country reversed its stance on the issue. Recent random antibody testing in New York reveals that 20% of that city’s population may have contracted Covid-19 and recovered on its own.
According to Muliyal, herd immunity may already be developing in India as reports come in of people with sub-clinical and mildly clinical symptoms. “Along with epidemic, the natural immunisation process is also going on… all I am saying is, don’t forget that,” he said, adding the country needs to worry about availability of beds in hospitals. This disease seems to spare the young, as mortality rates in that segment are very low, Muliyal said.
John described the lockdown as an act of stopping time. “It just froze time. Once you unfreeze time, whatever you stopped day before the lockdown, it will pick up. So, lockdown is not simply for reducing the transmission or flattening the curve, it is because you need time to prepare. And if you didn’t prepare in two weeks, you won’t be prepared in four weeks either,” he told ET.
John compared the lockdown effort for hunting the virus to the story of a ‘clever man’, who burnt down a house to kill a rat. “The lockdown was good for two weeks, three weeks was the upper limit. Anything more than that will be like burning the house down,” he said.
At the other end of the spectrum, two experts who are part of the National Task Force of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said the country needs to get used to a new normal.
The best post-lockdown strategy is to implement phased relief, with stricter containment measures guided by strong surveillance mechanisms. Herd immunity as a concept is mostly theoretical at this stage since reinfections are known to exist in communities that have had the infection earlier,” said Giridhara Babu, an infectious diseases expert with the Public Health Foundation of India.
""I think the lockdown has been successful in keeping the burden low, helping in preparedness and scaling up testing. It has proven most models predicting a worse scenario wrong,” said Sanjay Pujari, director of the Institute of Infectious Diseases.
Pujari said herd immunity may be a good concept for infections with low morbidity and fatality rates. But in case of Covid-19, trying to achieve herd immunity will lead to a surge in cases which will overwhelm health systems.

Israeli forces backed by fighter jets and drones carried out a second ground raid into Gaza in as many days and struck targets on the outskirts of Gaza City, the military said Friday, as it prepares for a widely expected ground invasion of the Hamas-ruled territory.

US warplanes meanwhile struck targets in eastern Syria that the Pentagon said were linked to Iran's Revolutionary Guard after a string of attacks on US forces by Iran-backed fighters, adding to the already high regional tensions fueled by the three-week-old Gaza war.

The Palestinian death toll has soared past 7,000 as Israel has carried out waves of devastating airstrikes in response to a bloody Hamas incursion into southern Israel on Oct 7. The Health Ministry in Gaza, which tracks the toll, released a detailed list of names and ID numbers on Thursday. The toll includes more than 2,900 minors and more than 1,500 women.

The overall number of deaths far exceeds the combined toll of all four previous wars between Israel and Hamas, estimated at around 4,000.

More than 1,400 people in Israel, mostly civilians, were slain during the initial Hamas attack, according to the Israeli government. Hamas is holding at least 229 captives inside Gaza, including men, women, children and older adults.

The airstrikes have flattened entire neighborhoods, causing a level of death and destruction unseen in the last four wars between Israel and Hamas. Over a million people have fled their homes, with many heeding Israeli orders to evacuate to the south, despite continuing Israeli strikes across the sealed-off territory.

The humanitarian crisis sparked by the war and the Israeli siege has sparked protests across the region, and more demonstrations were expected later Friday after weekly Muslim prayers.

The military said ground forces raided inside Gaza, striking dozens of militant targets over the past 24 hours. It said aircraft and artillery bombed targets in Shijaiyah, a neighborhood on the outskirts of Gaza City that was the scene of a bloody urban battle in the 2014 Gaza war.

The military said the soldiers exited the territory without suffering any casualties. It reported an earlier raid into northern Gaza early Thursday, saying ground forces battled militants and struck anti-tank missile firing positions in an operation that lasted hours.

Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, an Israeli military spokesman, said the raids enable forces to “uncover the enemy,” to kill militants and to remove explosives and launch pads. The aim is “to prepare the ground for the next stages of the war,” he added.

The damage to Gaza from nearly three weeks of bombardment showed in satellite photos of several locations taken before the war and again in recent days.

Entire rows of residential buildings simply disappear in the photos, reduced to smears of dust and rubble. A complex of 13 high-rises by the sea was pounded to dust near Gaza City's al-Shati refugee camp, leaving only a few tottering bits of facade. Just down the street, hardly anything remained in what had been a neighborhood of low-built homes on winding lanes, according to the photos by Maxar Technologies.

The military says it only strikes militant targets and accuses Hamas of operating among civilians in an attempt to protect its fighters. The Israeli military said an airstrike killed one of two masterminds of the Oct. 7 massacre, Shadi Barud, the head of Hamas' intelligence unit.

Palestinian militants have fired thousands of rockets into Israel since the war began.

Hamas' military wing said Thursday that Israeli bombardment has so far killed about 50 of the hostages. There was no immediate comment from Israeli officials, who have denied previous, similar claims.

The conflict has threatened to ignite a wider war across the region.

Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed ally of Hamas in Lebanon, has repeatedly traded fire with Israel along the border, and Israel has carried out airstrikes targeting Iran-linked groups in Syria. The United States has sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the region, along with additional fighter jets and other weaponry and personnel, in part to deter Iran and its allies from entering the war on the side of Hamas.

U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the strikes in eastern Syria were “a response to a series of ongoing and mostly unsuccessful attacks against U.S. Personnel in Iraq and Syria by Iranian-backed militia groups that began on Oct. 17.”

He said President Joe Biden directed the narrowly tailored strikes “to make clear that the United States will not tolerate such attacks and will defend itself, its personnel and its interests.” He added that the operation was separate and distinct from Israel's war against Hamas.

Syrian opposition activists in the area said the two locations are associated with Iranian arms shipments to militant groups in the region, and had been evacuated ahead of the strikes. There were no immediate reports of casualties.

Egyptian state media reported that six people were lightly wounded when a rocket slammed into a medical building in the town of Taba, on the border with Israel. It was not immediately known who fired the projectile.

Hagari, the Israeli military spokesperson, said “an aerial threat was identified in the area of the Red Sea,” which appeared to be the source of the blast in Egypt. He said fighter jets were dispatched to the area and that Israel, Egypt and the U.S. Were tightening their defenses in the region.

Last week, a U.S. Navy destroyer in the northern Red Sea shot down three cruise missiles and several drones launched toward Israel by Iran-backed Houthi rebels in northern Yemen.

In Gaza, supplies of food, medicine and fuel for powering emergency generators are running low. The U.N. Agency for Palestinian refugees, which provides basic services to hundreds of thousands of people, including operating schools turned into shelters, has said it may run out of fuel within days.

Gaza's sole power station shut down for lack of fuel days after the start of the war, and Israel has barred all fuel deliveries, saying it believes Hamas would steal them for military purposes.

About 1.4 million of Gaza's 2.3 million residents have fled their homes, with nearly half of them crowding into U.N. Shelters. Hundreds of thousands remain in northern Gaza, despite Israel ordering them to evacuate to the south and saying that those who remain might be considered “accomplices” of Hamas.

In recent days, Israel has let more than 70 trucks with aid enter from Egypt through the Rafah crossing, the only entry point into Gaza not controlled by Israel. But aid workers say the convoys meet only a tiny fraction of the territory's mounting humanitarian needs. Before the war, an average of 500 trucks entered Gaza each day.

The U.S. Has been working with other mediators to send in more humanitarian aid, but Israel is demanding strict screening to make sure none falls into the hands of Hamas. The U.S. Says Hamas has meanwhile refused to open the Gaza side of the Rafah crossing to let hundreds of foreign passport holders leave.

The United States on Friday expanded its effort to cut off funding for Hamas, announcing a second round of sanctions against people and organisations linked to the group since it launched an attack on Israel that killed more than 1,400 people.

The new sanctions highlight Iran's role in providing financial, logistical and operational support to Hamas, the US Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control said in a statement.

They include a Hamas representative in Iran and members of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard.

The sanctions were announced as Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo travelled to London to shore up support from Britain, one of America's closest allies, for the drive to squeeze off funding for Hamas, which both countries consider a terrorist organisation.

“Today's action underscores the United States' commitment to dismantling Hamas's funding networks by deploying our counterterrorism sanctions authorities and working with our global partners to deny Hamas the ability to exploit the international financial system,” Adeyemo said.

Among those targeted are Khaled Qaddoumi, described as a liaison between Hamas and the Iranian government; and Ali Morshed Shirazi and Mostafa Mohammad Khani, officials in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' Qods Force who are accused of training and assisting Hamas fighters.

The US also sanctioned a number of organisations, including the Iranian Bonyad Shahid, also known as the Martyrs Foundation. US officials say the group, which is affiliated with Palestinian Islamic Jihad, funnels millions of dollars through the Gaza-based Al-Ansar Charity Association for the families of militants.

The practice “ultimately serves as a recruiting tool for terrorist activities”, the US said.

The sanctions freeze any US-based assets owned or controlled by the named individuals and organisations. They also block financial transactions with those designated and prohibit the contribution of funds, goods and services to them.

El Salvador is charging passengers from Africa or India a $1,000 (over Rs 80,000) fee, in an apparent bid to curb migration to the US through the Central American country.
People traveling on passports from India or any one of more than 50 African nations will be obliged to pay the fee, El Salvador’s port authority said in a statement on its website dated October 20.
The money raised will be used to improve the nation’s main international airport, the authority added.
El Salvador President Nayib Bukele this week met Brian Nichols, US assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs, to discuss “efforts to address irregular migration,” among other topics. US Customs and Border Patrol encountered a record 3.2 million migrants across the country in fiscal year 2023, which ended in September.

Many migrants from Africa and elsewhere make it to the US via Central America.


Including VAT, the additional cost is $1,130 from travelers from the affected countries. The new fee took effect October 23 and was imposed due to increased use of the country’s main international airport, according to the statement.

Airlines will be required to notify Salvadoran authorities daily of passengers who come from a list of 57 countries in Africa, and India.


Colombian airline Avianca, which is one of the hub’s biggest users, began notifying travelers that passengers from the list of countries must pay the mandatory fee before boarding flights to El Salvador.","In the Arnia sector of Jammu and Kashmir, a Border Security Force (BSF) personnel sustained minor injuries in unprovoked firing by Pakistan Rangers.

AMRITSAR: The act of showering rose petals from a helicopter over the Golden Temple in Amritsar has triggered controversy and concerns, with some Sikh groups perceiving it as a violation of maryada (Sikh code of religious conduct) and a compromise to the temple's security.
Advocate Neena Singh, a member of Sikh Legal Aid (SLA), raised concerns about maintaining religious sanctity and the safety protocols of the Golden Temple. She emphasized that, given the sensitivity of the holy place, flights should not be allowed near or over the Golden Temple.

Neena also criticized the lack of religious decorum during the petal shower, pointing out that those involved did not cover their heads, indicating disrespect. She stated that it appeared as if they were on a joyride, which was highly objectionable.
The petal shower was organized by one Kuljit Singh, a Sikh devotee from Chamba in Himachal Pradesh, during the nagar kirtan (religious procession) on the birth anniversary of Sikh's fourth guru, Guru Ram Das.
Social media users, including those on X (formerly Twitter), expressed their discontent with the flower-showering act. Some criticized the lack of head coverings and emphasized the need for reverence in such a sacred place.

Neena has written letters to both the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) and the jathedar of Akal Takht, urging them not to allow aerial vehicles over the Golden Temple to ensure its security.


Kuljit Singh, who organized the petal shower, explained that the head cover was blown off due to a sudden gust of wind when the helicopter door was opened. He stated that they had obtained permission from both the SGPC and the district administration for the activity and would not have proceeded if there were any bans in place.

However, some Sikh bodies do not see any violation of maryada or security concerns in this act.


Balwinder Singh of the Hawara Committee mentioned that helicopters have flown over the Golden Temple in the past, and he did not perceive any violation of maryada during high-altitude flights over the temple.

Bengaluru: To ensure safe sale of crackers for Deepavali, the BBMP has identified 70 playgrounds where 426 temporary shops will be set up.

The Palike had submitted the list of grounds and shops that will be allowed in each to the police commissioner’s office. Cops will get a fire-safety report from the fire and emergency services before calling applications from those interested to open cracker shops.

These safety measures are being taken in the wake of the firecracker warehouse blaze at Attibele that claimed 17 lives in October. A drive after the tragedy had identified violations at several cracker establishments.

BBMP chief commissioner Tushar Giri Nath said zonal officials had been asked to identify safe playgrounds to set up cracker shops. Officials accordingly inspected the spots and prepared a list of playgrounds and number of shops to be opened.

Nath said he submitted the zonal-wise list to the police commissioner’s office. According to the list, east zone may have the highest number of shops — 101 on 23 grounds. South zone is likely to have 87 and Bommanahalli zone may get the least (six on three grounds).

Urban warfare in the Gaza Strip presents numerous challenges, such as narrow alleys, tall buildings, and underground tunnels. The IDF will face heavy resistance from Hamas, who have prepared their defenses over the years. The IDF has developed tactics and technologies for urban warfare, but they must also consider the international community's response to their actions.104686870

She said, ""Okay, I don't know if I should be saying this, but Cancer has touched our lives personally. First it was my dad and my mum got it earlier this year but she has come out of it, with the support of so many incredible doctors and a lot of love and blessings from everyone.""
She further added, ""But that is not the reason why we are working towards the cause of cancer patients. One doesn't really work towards something if it affects them, we've been associated with this cause earlier too and the fact that my mother also went through it was incidental.""

It'll continue to be my way of life to be able to do my karm and be there in anyway I can for people in my life and anyone's life who I can touch.

But more so, to the audience because of the support they've given me to be able to do anything that's impactful. To my audience - you give me the power, ability to enrich others' life but it's you who enrich my life.""
She cut the cake with the media and the cancer patients, however didn't eat the cake as she's fasting for karwa chauth today.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday promised to get back every penny of the black money stashed abroad, days after his government was accused of making a U-turn on the issue.

He said the efforts to bring back black money stashed abroad are on the “right track” even as he acknowledged that there was no correct estimate about how much money is kept illegally in foreign countries.

In an address to the nation over radio, he said that bringing back black money from outside the country is an “article of faith” for him and nothing will be lacking in his efforts to do so.

The Prime Minister’s commitment to bring back black money stashed abroad comes against the backdrop of the stand it first took in the Supreme Court last week about the inability to disclose the names of the account holders in foreign banks because of the confidentially clause in treaties with other countries.

It had maintained that disclosure of details of account holders would hamper efforts to bring back black money.

The government beat a hasty retreat after the Supreme Court ordered it to disclose the names of account holders in HSBC Geneva which amounted to 627 in number. The government also came under attack from opposition parties that it was going back on its election promise to unearth and bring back black money stashed abroad.

Modi said there may be differences in approach on getting this money back but he was committed to doing it and the nation should have faith in him.

“As far as black money is concerned, you should have faith on this ‘Pradhan sevak’. For me, it is an article of faith. Every penny of the money of poor people in this country, which has gone out, should return. This is my commitment,” Modi said in ‘Mann ki Baat’ programme on All-India Radio.

“There may be differences over the approach and procedures, which is natural in a democracy. But as far as my understanding goes and on the basis of information I have, I can say we are on the right track,” he said.

On the actual estimate about amount in illegal bank accounts in foreign countries, the Prime Minister said, “Nobody knows, nor do I know, nor does the government know, nor do you know, how much money is stashed abroad. Even the previous government had no estimate.

“Everybody is making own assessment of figures. I do not want to get involved in those figures. It is my commitment that whatever amount, Rs 2, Rs 5, crore of rupees or whatever, this money belongs to the poor people of this country and should come back.

“And I can assure you that nothing will be lacking in my efforts. I only want your blessings to continue.”

He asserted that whatever has to be done, will be done at the earliest.

In his second radio address, which lasted about 20 minutes, the Prime Minister also talked about his government’s initiatives like those related to the specially-abled children and cleaning the country besides social problems like drug addiction.

He also paid tributes to the armed forces while referring to his visit to Siachen in Jammu and Kashmir on Diwali day on October 23, where soldiers live in difficult conditions.

With regard to the specially-abled people, he announced that a special scholarship will be given to 1,000 such children by the HRD Ministry.

One lakh rupees each will also be given to Kendriya Vidhyalayas and Central universities for creating infrastructure for the specially-abled children, he said.

“A good beginning has been made and things will change,” he said, adding that the country is headed towards a “big change“

Talking about the ‘Swachh Bharat’ drive launched on October 2, he appreciated the personalities from various walks of life as well as common people for participating in the campaign.

“Had anybody thought that it will become a nationwide campaign? ... Things are changing and people are becoming aware that they should not throw filth around,” Modi said, adding that the maximum impact of the drive has been on children.

Linking the cleanliness drive to healthcare, he said the poor people are the worst affected by dirt as they fall ill which affects their livelihood.

While talking about the changing mindset of people on the issue, he said that many personalities, including business leaders, sports persons and film actors who meet him now discuss social issues. — PTI

Donald Trump will likely surrender to the Manhattan District Attorney’s (DA) office early next week, his attorney Joe Tacopina told NBC News. Multiple sources familiar with the situation also said the former US President's legal team is in touch with prosecutors and his arraignment is also expected to take place next week.

A New York grand jury indicted Donald Trump on Thursday over hush money paid to pornstar Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 presidential election. He became the first US president to face criminal charges.
A spokesperson for the DA said they are already in contact with Trump's lawyer to arrange his surrender. ""We contacted Mr Trump’s attorney to coordinate his surrender to the Manhattan DA’s Office for arraignment on a Supreme Court indictment, which remains under seal,"" the spokesperson was quoted by NBC as saying.

To ensure a safe surrender, the Secret Service will coordinate with authorities in New York and Trump's legal team for his transportation and security needs.

The charges against Trump came after a years-long investigation into a payment made by his personal lawyer to porn star Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 presidential election. A grand jury voted to indict him after investigating a $130,000 pay-out to Stormy Daniels in an attempt to silence her over an alleged affair.


Trump has called the investigations ""political persecution"" and said he was ""completely innocent"".

Indian diplomatic missions in the UK, USA, Australia and Canada have recently been subjected to violent and abusive protests by pro-Khalistan Sikhs. If I were at Ground Zero, I would have simply walked around with a sheaf of foolscap papers and asked the agitators to write an essay about the proposed Khalistan. The essay must address the issues of territory, a form of government, the relationship between the state and church (SGPC), economy, demography (38 per cent non-Sikhs in Punjab, and Sikhs in the rest of India) etc. However, the essay reveals the “Khali-stan” (empty space) that exists in their minds.

Over the last 50 years, the ‘movement’ has preferred to dodge these fundamental questions. Thousands of lives have been lost in an organised misconception. Territory is the basic component of a sovereign state. The maps of the proposed Khalistan are ludicrous. In the 1980s, Khushwant Singh purchased a Khalistan map published in England, for £2. “According to this map”, he wrote in 1992, “Khalistan will include Jammu, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, New Delhi, chunks of UP, Rajasthan and Saurashtra to give the state an outlet to the sea. By rough reckoning, the Sikh population will be 13 per cent. What kind of Sikh state will this be? Clearly, not democratic.” (My Bleeding Punjab, P.155-156).

A recent example of this lack of clarity is the fanciful Khalistan map issued by Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, of Sikhs For Justice, in June 2022 at the Lahore Press Club. Besides the Indian Punjab, it encompasses almost the whole of Haryana, Himachal, five Rajasthan districts, several Uttarakhand districts (including Dehradun and Haridwar), and a number of districts of UP. It included Gurugram, though Delhi was left out. Shimla was the capital of Khalistan, though Sikhs comprised 1.95 per cent of the city. Pro-Khalistani graffiti was actually found pasted on the Assembly Building at Dharamsala (Kangra district) on May 8, 2022, and scribes in Himachal Pradesh received pre-recorded Khalistani threat calls on their mobiles. However, in the Melbourne round of a referendum by the outfit in January, the question was whether “Indian-governed Punjab should be an independent country— Yes or No”. Where does that leave the June 2022 map?

As per the referendum, sovereign Khalistan would be a landlocked country between India and Pakistan. Punjab farmers, overwhelmingly Jatt Sikhs, are heavily dependent on rice and wheat from the Centre. This was borne out by the massive farmers’ agitation (2020-21) compelling the Government to cancel the farm laws. One would be interested in knowing how Khalistan proponents plan to offload Punjab rice and wheat mounds.

Nobody has yet seen a draft Khalistan constitution even after 50 years. The Khalsa Raj Party Constitution issued by Lt Col Partap Singh (Retd) on May 15, 1991, at Chandigarh, issued towards the end of the Khalistani insurgency, was expected to condense all wisdom on Khalistan. It advocates an independent, sovereign Sikh homeland and restricts its boundaries to Punjab and adjoining Punjabi-speaking areas ‘fraudulently kept out during a Punjab reorganisation in 1966”. Herein, Lt Col Singh assumes all Punjabi-speaking persons in India are Sikhs, and vice versa, wherein in reality 38 per cent of Punjab population according to Census 2011 is Hindu.

Will Khalistan be a democracy and a theocracy at the same time? It is open to multiple interpretations but it says nothing about the SGPC. The ‘movement’ is a bundle of imponderables, deliberately retained by its sponsors. It fits American author Paul Elridge’s description, “Man is willing to die for any idea, provided that idea is not clear to him.”

India’s vision of a ‘Look East’ policy and Japan’s vision regarding a free and open Indo Pacific meet in India’s landlocked northeast. India for long has championed its ‘Look East’ policy. This aims to develop deeper relations with countries in South East Asia and the Bay of Bengal region through northeastern (much to be tapped) States as a major gateway. Meanwhile, for more than a decade, Japan has been focusing on free, open and fair Indo Pacific policy, with emphasis on free movement of people, trade across land, sea and air routes, all through the region. India's northeastern States form an important access node.

Last week Japanese Prime Minister Kishida, during his India visit, reemphasised the desire to pursue a more engaged Indo Pacific policy. This has for the past two years become the most strategic foreign policy component for the US and Europe. It is also the glue holding together India, US, Australia and Japan in their QUAD grouping.

Japan has been promoting key infrastructure projects in India’s northeast to create seamless trade and transport routes. It has been assisting in developing northeast road network connectivity improvement projects in Assam and Meghalaya, sewage and water supply projects in Assam, development of schools in Manipur, projects related to forest management in Tripura and Nagaland and sustainable agriculture projects in Mizoram. Japan’s investment in the northeast is $2 billion so far. In addition, the Japanese Government has picked up key infrastructure projects such as the MatarBari deep water port in Bangladesh. This will be complemented by the construction of connecting roads in Assam, Mizoram and Tripura. Once completed, these infrastructure projects would provide seamless access from the northeast to Bay of Bengal sea ports. In addition, they would serve as a major trade transit route for goods from Southeast Asia and beyond.

 This promises to bring more prosperity to the entire region, not just within India's geographical boundaries. It fits well into the Japanese vision of comprehensive economic and regional development, based on law. It may be noteworthy that the other Asian giant, China, has rapidly expanded its sphere of influence in the region through its opaque Belt and Road Initiative. This has tied many of these countries into multiyear fatal debt traps. India and Japan are the major economies not part of China's debt trap infrastructure financing projects. Their vision for the Indo Pacific is different from China’s.

India and Japan, during the leadership meeting in New Delhi, highlighted the need for expanding the partnership to more ASEAN countries. Even the QUAD Foreign Ministers’ meeting in March emphasised the centrality of ASEAN and the need for greater engagement. It is significant that Japan is working in a structured manner in India’s neighbourhood. This is with some of India’s most trusted allies such as Bangladesh on a path of regional prosperity. Japan has been working with India since 2017 to support NE’s development. Japan has clearly articulated that it is keen to tie the two ports, one in Bangladesh and the other in India’s NE, for greater economic cooperation.

Meanwhile, Minister of State for External Affairs Rajkumar Ranjan Singh while addressing a BIMSTEC meet in Kolkata this week stressed the need for India’s north eastern region to be the leading edge of India’s Act East diplomacy. He emphasised the need for developing transportation facilities and trade within BIMSTEC partners. His caution for BIMSTEC countries was to follow a modest yet practical approach. Any creative solutions for increasing trade in this region also click well with Japan’s push for increased economic prosperity and connectivity for the Indo Pacific.

The 10-day Habitat International Film Festival (HIFF) was a visual treat for film-loving communities in Delhi and the NCR. Thanks to Sunit Tandon (Director, India Habitat Centre) and Vidyun Singh (Programme Head) along with her team to bring the award-winning, critically acclaimed films from Cannes, Berlin and other renowned film festivals.

This year, HIFF screened 60 films from 20 countries, with Australia as the focus country. From factual to fantastical, from surreal to sci-fi, this edition took place from March 17 to 26.

Tandon says, “The HIFF is back in its full-fledged form this year. We also bring a cutting-edge VR Section to the festival for the first time. Aspiring filmmakers will not want to miss the unique opportunity provided by Kieslowski Film School Documentary Workshop.”

From Australia, six of the finest contemporary films of 2022 and 2023 have been screened with the opening film, The Dreamlife of Georgie Stone, showcasing the elliptical memories of the teen activist’s historic fight for transgender rights; Ivan Sen’s Limbo arrives fresh off the boat from its Berlinale 2023 premiere; others include The Lonely Spirits Variety Hour, Sweet As, and Survival of Kindness.

Filmmakers and editors from the Kielowski Film School from Poland trained the young minds in a four-day documentary workshop. Grzegorz Paprzycki, an acclaimed upcoming voice in contemporary Polish cinema and Kieslowski Film School alumni was one of the workshop trainers. A hands-on workshop, with live editing sessions, discussions and practical exercises designed to hone their skills as filmmakers was an added advantage for the local young filmmakers.

For the first time as part of the festival, cinema’s latest innovation — VR and 360° video — was presented in partnership with the Goethe Institute. The Virtual Reality programme — a package of animation, short and documentary films — explores the relationship between the past and present. It also adds a whole new dimension to film watching for the audience.

Four films in the MUBI Friday section that approach the anarchy of love and its expression across different eras — the classic In The Mood For Love by Wong Kar-wai, to the contemporary Paris, 13th district by Jacques Audiard and The Worst Person in the World by Joachim Trier, even the futuristic Crimes of The Future by David Cronenberg.

Eight biggest attraction at HIFF were: Elvis, the buzzing Austin Butler-starrer, Baz Luhrmann biopic that premiered at Cannes (and has won many awards subsequently); Rheingold, Fatih Akin’s (Germany, Netherlands, Morocco, Mexico) high-octane adaptation of the swagger and bombast of German rap star Xatar’s 2015 autobiography ‘All Or Nothing’; winner of 16 awards and 51 nominations, including the much-coveted Golden Bear (Berlinale 2022) - Carla Simón’s (Spain), Alcarras, a deeply intelligent and empathetic humane drama that engulfs you in the heat and dust and dysfunction created by market forces; Perfect Number - the return of veteran Polish filmmaker Krzysztof Zanussi and his search for philosophical answers in mathematical theories; the poignant We are Still Here, an anthology film about stories of indigenous heroes from Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific; winner of the Best Screenplay at Cannes 2022, Boy From Heaven, takes us into the heart of a ruthless power struggle between Egypt's religious and political elites; the latest Berlinale awardee (2023), The Survival of Kindness, follows a black woman’s escape from a cage in the middle of the desert to the city, recapture, and tragedy; and Oscar nominee 'EO' by Jerzy Skolimowski (Poland) follows a donkey that encounters good and bad people, experiences joy and pain, exploring a vision of modern Europe.

Further enriching the feature line-up are some equally remarkable documentaries, shorts, and animation films. DOC NYC 2022 nominee Closed Circuit by Tel Inbar (Israel) is a documentary that captures the heart-pounding trauma of the 2016 terrorist attack in Tel Aviv’s Sarona Market; Winner of ‘Best Documentary Feature’ at The Roxbury International Film Festival and Filmocracy Fest, Hostile by UK filmmaker Sonita Gale explores the UK’s complicated relationship with its migrant communities; Winner at the Warsaw Film Festival 2022, Region of Heroes by Artur Lerman (Ukraine) is the story of those who selflessly saved thousands of Ukrainians during the Russian occupation; winner of the Special Jury Award at Roxbury Film Festival and the International Humanitarian Award at Flickers’ Rhode Island International Film Festival, The Bengali by Kavery Kaul (USA) is the story of a writer from Louisiana who embarks on a quest to India to look for her grandfather's descendants. Curated packages from Poland and Sri Lanka also embellished the festival.","India's ""Look East"" policy and Japan's ""free and open Indo-Pacific"" vision intersect in India's northeastern region. Japan, during Prime Minister Kishida's visit, expressed a commitment to a more engaged Indo-Pacific strategy, aligning with the US, Europe, India, and Australia's QUAD grouping. Japan has invested $2 billion in the Indian northeast, promoting infrastructure projects and trade routes. This collaboration aims to bring prosperity to the entire region and counter China's debt-trap initiatives in Asia. The focus on expanding partnerships with ASEAN countries and connecting ports in India and Bangladesh underscores the commitment to regional development and economic cooperation. India's northeastern region plays a crucial role in these diplomatic efforts.

The BJP is looking for a home run no doubt but its latest momentum on the Ram temple at Ayodhya or its craftsmanship of a people-friendly budget, howsoever temporary, indicate the burden that none of the Opposition parties has to carry, that of holding out its report card. In short, how much of an achche din was it able to usher, rather how many achche dins in the five-year tenure? So its exam rush hyperactivity is understandable in making up for a paltry performance in comparison to the decisive verdict of 2014, one that no ruling party enjoyed over the last decade. By that measure, that chasm is wide indeed.

The Ram Mandir is an emotionally galvanising force that had got the Sangh Parivar close to claiming political power through the BJP. But governance demanded pragmatism and through the Vajpayee and Modi years, Ayodhya has at best been cannon fodder for rhetoric and a subject of ideological reverence given the legal complexities concerned. And fringe issues like gauraksha or polarisation have been more of an embarrassment and headache than serving the Hindu cause over the last few years. But now that the party’s development agenda doesn’t look shiny enough, post the electoral debacle in the heartland States, and it needs to re-energise its cadres relying on the RSS grassroots network, it has to be seen as being purposeful about the temple. This has become necessary after the downbeat mood of workers at the last parliamentary party meeting hit home. Besides, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat and even old ally Shiv Sena have launched a pincer attack on the unfulfilled promise of a Ram temple, saying that would, if not anything, address the BJP’s reason for being. Even the BJP’s latest plea of returning the superfluous land outside the disputed site in Ayodhya to owners is fraught with legal interjections, some claiming that the fate of that too is linked to a decision on the title suit. But the party brass is hoping it will at least be seen as attempting a closure within legal perimeters, even if not entirely successful. Politically, it would allow it to neutralise a resurgent Congress, which is itself pursuing soft Hindutva. In fact, the Congress is on the backfoot on Ayodhya and has refused TV debates on the subject.

However, Modi’s bigger concern is the electorate which feels betrayed and comprises the poor, both rural and urban, and the middle classes. The temple, as ground surveys indicate, is hardly expected to wash off on an aspirational society, more interested in livelihood indices than identity. And with Congress chief Rahul Gandhi having already floated the idea of a universal basic income, the BJP has to be seen as a healer given the crippling intensity of farm distress and the cascading effects of demonestisation. There is talk of the interim Budget promising direct money transfers to farmers’ accounts, waiving off interest on crop loans for farmers who pay on time, revising tax slabs and even announcing relief for petroleum companies to arrest fuel prices. Of course, nobody is asking where the money will come from. But will last-minute affirmative action and a veiled election manifesto work for the BJP government? The Indian voter has become much too aware to be enchanted by the gimmickry of grants and sops. It was precisely because they were tired of these populist fruits dangled by previous regimes that they gave a monolithic verdict hoping that the Modi government would have the mandate to take decisive steps. Alas, those came few and far between adventurist moves and the report card, in the end, has a repetitive feel about it. Faith takes time to build, just a moment to destroy. Modi was seen as a tall leader, still is. Hence the expectation of him to be less formulaic and not resort to cliches. Particularly of the 11th hour kind.

The most significant thing about India’s rise — by three ranks — to the 78th position in Transparency International’s corruption perceptions index is the fact that the country has jumped past its bigger Eastern neighbour, China. In fact, the Middle Kingdom has dropped dramatically in the corruption rankings. Predictably, the communist media will dismiss the report but the fact is that under President Xi Jinping, who made fighting corruption a supposed cornerstone of his administration, the unscrupulous boomed thanks to projects like the Belt and Road Initiative. Corruption in China was just a stick used by Xi to eliminate his political rivals. However, India’s slight rise overtaking China is also a sign that under the Narendra Modi dispensation, there has been a palpable sense that large-scale political corruption reduced. This is not to say that every estate of the Indian state, including the fourth estate, the media, is riddled with scams. But as they say, we must take baby steps to start with.

India’s problem is not just of corruption across the executive but that the malaise has taken root in society much like an invasive plant species and it is extremely difficult to remove it. The current state of Indian banks because of their profligate lending habits was in no small part due to questionable understanding between parties. Besides one has to understand that corruption is not always a case of money changing hands, it is also that network of favours. A job for a relative, school admission for a child, the worst forms of a corrupt system rarely involve money. Removing that will take years of work and a mindset change that everything, from chai-pani as the telephone lineman once asked for just to do his job to the payoffs for contracts, is wrong and that means teaching children at a very young age that corruption is bad. But in a country with an economic disparity as wide as that in India, eliminating corruption is almost impossible. That does not mean that we should not do our utmost to try and reduce it. There is little authentic economic data to prove this but rough calculations made by anti-corruption watchdogs show that we lose a percentage point or more of growth every year thanks to graft cases. Because it almost always benefits a few at the cost of the many. The poor municipal roads and potholes courtesy the a contractor ‘mafia’ in many cities are evidence of this. So yes, while we should be pleased with our rise and have a bit of schadenfreude about China's decline, we should not lose sight of the fact that the road ahead to reducing corruption is a long and a hard one.

While travelling across central India, especially through the Western Ghats, one will not fail to observe the clear-cut changes made to the topography of the region. The lush, green forests and the tree canopy have all steadily declined in the last few years. Vegetation has given way to more dusty, dry-looking land that seems to exist throughout the year. The meandering forest streams that once used to punctuate the verdant forests have all dried up along with the forest cover. As the Indian hinterland shows some changes that are in tune with worsening climate change, the world itself is realising that a much larger problem — thanks to rapid climate change — is knocking on the door, which is the issue of rapid desertification.

As greening and afforestation measures have proved to be an uphill task, desertification is fast making an already difficult battle even tougher. This aspect was very much evident during the recent 17th Session of the Committee for the Review of the Implementation (CRIC17) of the United Nation’s Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) in Guyana. The gathering understood the need for emergency steps to stop desertification that now grips almost all countries around the world.

The preliminary assessment report circulated by the Secretariat of the UNCCD found that in the first 15 years of the millennium, 20 per cent of the world’s productive and healthy land was degraded. This seemingly low-level threat has now cornered 169 countries in its grip, leading to rapid land degradation and impacting nearly 3.2 billion people economically. The assessment was made on the basis of data submitted by 135 countries. In October, 2015, after the world adopted the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the 12th Conference of parties to UNCCD endorsed the SDG target 15.3. Under this target lies a new concept called land degradation neutrality, according to which, countries are attempting to halt land degradation through desertification.

One of the crucial aspects to containing desertification is to understand the speed and area of concentration of the deserted land and the factors that trigger the same. Moreover, besides adversely impacting the people economically, degraded lands and soils pose a severe threat to the provision of ecosystem services and economic development globally. Given the gravity of the problem, in the last four years alone, 82 countries, including India, have committed to stop land degradation by 2030. But without an adequate plan for land governance, education, demography and land use planning, this ambitious target seems difficult to be achieved.

In order to attain meaningful progress in controlling desertification, instead of treating the symptoms of land degradation, India must focus on the causes. The immediate cause that typically triggers desertification is the loss of primary vegetation. Most lands fall prey to mining and other unnatural activities which result in the removal of vegetation due to human activities.

Sustained lack of green cover causes a dry land to develop an arid nature and eventually results in what can be termed as the “death of the topsoil.” This renders re-growth of any greenery almost impossible and leaves the land degraded.

Then there are also other factors that drive the disappearance of the green cover such as drought, climatic shifts, tillage for agriculture, overgrazing and deforestation for fuel or construction materials. Vegetation plays a major role in determining the biological composition of the soil.

Studies have shown that in many environments, the rate of erosion and run-off decreases exponentially with increased vegetation cover. Unprotected, dry soil surfaces blow away with the wind or are washed off by flash floods, thereby leaving infertile lower soil layers that bake in the sun and become unproductive hardpan, which is an apt environment for desertification.

In fact, according to many scientists, one of the most common causes for desertification is overgrazing or excessive consumption of vegetation by the cattle. The scientific community also concurs with this contention. Interestingly, facts show that there is a natural cause for the existence of desert in the place, which is now the Sahara desert. A natural climate cycle that caused a lack of water in this area from time to time, coupled with overgrazing by the local population, slowly converted the Sahara savanna to the Sahara desert. Precipitation factors were aided by climate change that also caused the acceleration and led to the formation of deserts.

India must recognise the patterns and perceive the threats that dry lands in various parts of the country face. Due to the lack of natural water sources, or drying up of the same, coupled with the problem of overgrazing, Indian lands are faced with the danger of becoming degraded and may eventually be deserted.

The first step to prevent the same will be to ensure that satellite data is employed to create a detailed database that categorises the lands and identifies those that are on the edge of becoming deserts. Emergency measures of replenishing the groundwater table, stopping anthropogenic activities and refreshing the green cover can be immediate solutions. Land is precious and in short supply thanks to population explosion. To lose the little land to deserts would be a true misfortune for India.

According to an official statement, the decision was taken at a Cabinet meeting chaired by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal. “The Cabinet in its meeting on Tuesday, chaired by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, recommended convening of the eighth session (Budget Session) of the sixth Delhi Legislative Assembly from February 22-28, 2019,” the Government said in the statement.

While emotionally significant, the temple remains a recurring topic rather than a solved matter. The party seeks closure through returning land but faces legal complexities. Aiming to counter a resurgent Congress and heal voter disillusionment, it plans last-minute actions like direct money transfers. However, such measures might not sway an electorate focused on livelihood over identity politics. Modi’s leadership, expected less formulaic, faces scrutiny for lacking decisive steps amidst repeated populist gestures. Voter disillusionment challenges the party's reliance on last-minute maneuvers.

Hamas is the bullet, Iran the gun, and China the person who pulled the trigger on the gun to fire the bullet that led to the Israel-Hamas war.

Iran’s partner in the global geopolitical game of survival in an existential crisis of diplomatic isolation, regional tensions, and a fragile economy is China. The Iranian regime views China as a potential ally against the United States, and Beijing views Iran as a potential partner for limiting U.S. influence in the Middle East.

China has remained Iran’s largest trading partner for 10 consecutive years as of 2022, according to the Chinese Ministry of Commerce. China-Iran trade totaled USD 15.8 billion in 2022, up 7 percent year-on-year. In 2021, China agreed to invest between USD 400 to USD 600 billion in Iran over the next 25 years. In the field of transportation alone, China is going to invest USD 12 billion, which includes projects like the high-speed rail link between Tehran and Mashhad, and investment in the Imam Khomeini Airport City. China’s crude oil imports from Iran reportedly set a new record in December 2022.

China’s economic ties to Iran have shielded the Iranian regime from the effects of international sanctions. Over the past several years, China has become Iran’s number one oil customer and trading partner. China has saved roughly USD 4.2 billion by importing a record 1 million bpd from Iran from January 2023 to September 2023, 60 percent above pre-sanction peaks recorded by Chinese customs in 2017 at 623,000 bpd, as Tehran raised output to near-maximum levels and offered discounts as steep as USD 17 a barrel versus Brent.

In March 2023, China brokered an agreement between Iran and Saudi Arabia to restore diplomatic ties seven years after severing relations. The deal reflected Beijing’s growing influence and interest in Iran and in the Middle East.

China has aided Iran’s efforts to modernize its military hardware and doctrine through the transfer of military technology and sales of small arms and tactical ballistic and anti-ship cruise missiles. China has also assisted in the development of Iran’s nuclear program through the transfer of technology and machinery. In August 2023, Iran became the newest member of the SCO, joining China, Russia, India, Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and Tajikistan. This grants Iran a freer hand to openly trade arms with Russia, China, and other SCO countries, which will result in Iran’s expanding its influence and aggression in the region.

Fighting and tension between Israel – Palestine in the West Bank, and Israel – Hamas in Gaza helped advance Iran’s aim of undermining US and Israel ties with Iran’s rivals in the Middle East region – Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, and the United Arab Emirates. With the Abraham Accords, the United States under former US President Donald Trump scored a major diplomatic victory in which Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates agreed to have diplomatic relations with Israel.

Saudi Arabia and Israel were to strengthen their diplomatic relations in keeping with the Abraham Accords but the ongoing Israel-Hamas war has put those plans on ice. China to counter the influence of the United States in the Middle East impressed upon Iran to restore diplomatic relations with Saudi Arabia. China through Iran may have encouraged Hamas to attack Israel.

Hamas gains considerably from Iran’s provision of weapons, technology, training, and financing of terror operations. This support allows Hamas to carry out attacks against Israel. Iran sees Hamas and the Palestine Islamic Jihad, as crucial centers of power in the Palestinian arena and uses these terror organizations to further its agenda against Israel.

Since the Gaza-Israel conflict escalated on October 7, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has repeatedly stated that the question of Palestine needs to be resolved as soon as possible, and the establishment of an independent Palestinian state is the only way to solve the question. Only when the “two-state solution” is fully implemented in the Middle East can real peace be ushered in. In fact, China’s position on the Palestinian concerns has been consistent. China backs the establishment of an independent Palestinian state based on relevant United Nations documents and resolves the Palestinian-Israeli conflict through peaceful negotiations.

China does not directly work with Hamas, but it uses Iran to work with Hamas. Iran provides financial aid, weapons, training, and technological support to Hamas. The Israel-Hamas war will see more of China’s engagement in the Middle East. China is expected to play an enhanced role in efforts to end the war and secure its economic interests and wants to capitalize on the Arab states’ frustration with the U.S. to establish itself as a great power in the region.

Middle-East is crucial to China’s Belt Road Initiative (BRI) for its energy exports and over the years China has been deepening its economic cooperation with Middle-Eastern countries. Chinese investments and construction projects in two of the most prominent Arab nations – Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have totaled USD 97 billion. China has pursued a proactive foreign policy and it is looking at its investments in the railways, roads, seaports, and airports as an extension of its influence in the Middle East.

The Chinese government has always propagated a narrative on the Israel-Palestine conflict that places the blame on Israel. That is because Israel is a close ally of the US and it is the objective of the CCP to undermine the United States government in the international geopolitical community.

The Israel-Hamas war has put on hold the peace talks between Israel and Saudi Arabia. China has ensured through Iran and Hamas that the Middle East region remains in a state of war. For China, the crisis is a chance to establish itself as a kingmaker in the Middle East, win ground from the United State and strengthen partnerships with Russia and across the Arab world. China has got Iran to use its pet Hamas well.

Federal Reserve, Chair Jerome Powell, speaks, speech, Moynihan Lecture,

What Powell has to say at the 2023 Moynihan Lecture in Social Science and Public Policy, Washington, D.C. remains to be heard.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will be speaking today at the 2023 Moynihan Lecture in Social Science and Public Policy, Washington, D.C. On Wednesday, October 25, at 2035 GMT or 4:35 p.m. ET, Fed Chief Jerome Powell gives brief introductory remarks before the 2023 Moynihan Lecture in Social Science and Public Policy event – 2035 GMT.

In four successive presidential administrations—those of John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard M. Nixon, and Gerald R. Ford—Daniel Patrick Moynihan (1927–2003) served as a member. He served four terms in the US Senate beginning in 1976 after serving as both India’s and the UN’s ambassador.


Last week on October 19, 2023, Powell was at the Economic Club of New York, where he discussed recent economic data and the outlook for monetary policy. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that the US central bank is likely to maintain interest rates constant at its next meeting, while leaving the door open for a future raise if policymakers see more signs of sustained economic growth.

The comments virtually confirmed market predictions that the Fed would avoid raising interest rates for the second time in a row when policymakers meet on October 31 and November 1. The Fed chairman also stated that if recent increases in long-term Treasury yields continue, it may reduce the need for more rate hikes.

“Given the uncertainties and risks, and how far we have come, the committee is proceeding carefully,” Powell said Thursday at the Economic Club of New York. “We will make decisions about the extent of additional policy firming and how long policy will remain restrictive based on the totality of the incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.”

At the same time, recent economic statistics indicated that US retail sales beat expectations and industrial production increased in September, while nonfarm payroll additions averaged 266,000 over the previous three months, indicating a healthy pace.

Last month, authorities held their policy rate constant in a range of 5.25% to 5.5%, and their predictions showed that 12 of 19 officials forecasted one more raise this year. In his remarks, Powell was careful not to rule out the potential of more tightening. What Powell has to say at the 2023 Moynihan Lecture in Social Science and Public Policy, Washington, D.C. remains to be heard.

CHANGLANG, 24 Oct: In a shocking development, the presence – or rather, the absence – of ghost staffers has surfaced in the education department in Changlang district.

The development comes in the wake of rampant illegal appointments made in the department across the state.

Changlang DC Sunny K Singh issued an order on 20 October, stating that “some ghost staffers have been detected in the education department who are drawing salaries without physical presence.”


Stating that there is a possibility of similar ghost staffers’ ‘presence’ in other departments also, Singh further directed all heads of departments in the district to “verify the status and submit a certificate that all employees of their respective departments exist on the ground.”

The DC had on 19 October issued a notice to the Changlang DDSE, directing the latter to “verify all the regular staffers, including teaching and non-teaching staffers such as LDC, UDC, MTS, etc, through BRCCs and CRCCs, in order to rule out the existence of any ghost staffer enrolled with the education department.”

“It has been brought to the notice of the administration that there appear few regular staffers of the education department whose presence in the district is difficult to establish, yet their salary is drawn every month,” the DC stated.

He further pointed out that “there is a possibility of ghost staffers drawing salaries without their presence, and their antecedents only exist on paper, which, if established to be correct, will be deemed illegal and unlawful.”

It is learnt that the DDSE is yet to respond to the DC’s directive to submit the report.

It is alleged that five staffers under the DDSE have questionable appointment orders. However, their salaries were processed till September this year from Itanagar.

Among the five staffers, it is alleged that one was attached with Deputy Speaker and Changlang MLA Tesam Pongte’s private residence, and another staffer was attached with the DDSE.


Unverified sources claimed that the salaries of the ghost staffers were held back recently, after a minor shuffling among the staffers in the directorate office. The sources further said that the matter came to light after a few questionable staffers started approaching various authorities, seeking remedy and reinstatement of their salaries.

It is reported also that an LDC and a UDC, who never joined duty in Changlang, were allegedly drawing their salaries.

“Their presence in the district could not be established. The salaries of the employees are made based on attendance registers; so there emerges a valid question that, if they were not present, how come their attendance was marked and thus salaries processed month after month?” asked an angry youth on condition of anonymity.

“The disclosure of this new episode has brought to the fore many unanswered questions for the education department to clarify,” he said.

 It is alleged that the ghost staffers were appointed during the then DDSE Ego Doye’s tenure. However, when this daily contacted him, Doye denied the allegation and said that the appointments were made by the directorate and not by him.

When contacted, Education Commissioner Amjad Tak said that the education department is committed to unearth the truth. “If the allegations are true, appropriate action will be immediately initiated, whoever is involved in the scam,” Tak said.


The vigilance department is currently investigating illegal appointment of PRTs, TGTs, UDCs, LDCs and MTS staffers in the education department.

Listening to Ram talk about how he prepped himself up to play a ���regular-guy-next-door��� in Nenu..Sailaja��� is quite fascinating. Admittedly, director Kishore Tirumala felt the actor was too lean and needed to beef-up to look the part. So the actor decided to put on as much as 10 kilos to look convincing. ���Nenu.. Sailaja��� is a very realistic love story devoid of the usual frills. I play a real guy in the film, the sort that everyone would be able to identify with, someone they know. I���d lost weight to get lean for Pandaga Chesko. Kishore felt my frame was a little too bony to play a regular guy. So, I decided to pile on the pounds and trust me gaining weight isn���t easy,��� shares Ram who is paired opposite Keerthy Suresh in Nenu.. Sailaja..., produced by PV Kishore under Sri Sravanthi Movies.
From selecting the costumes to zeroing in on his hairstyle, extreme care was taken to ensure Ram looked like the guy you���d meet on the street. ���I generally shop abroad for my costumes in the films. But for Nenu.. Sailaja���, the clothes I wear needed to be very commonplace and we sourced them from regular stores. And that���s the reason we kept the look very simple,��� he explains.
In fact, they wanted to make the film so real that they shot only in locations in the country. ���I believed in the director���s vision and he felt there���s no necessity for a foreign locale in a film which is simple and subtle. Well, I think the result is pretty amazing,��� he signs off.
Nenu.. Sailaja... releases today.

Lyricist Na Muthukumar has written 94 songs in 33 films in 2015, and he claims that he has been this prolific for the past 12 years. Revealing how he manages to avoid creative blocks, the National Award-winner says, 'I read a lot, both in Tamil and English. I also watch a lot of world cinema, and travel. If I work continuously for 10 days, I take a break for four days to refresh myself

I spend time with my family, play with my son and that rejuvenates me.'
To ensure that his lines remain fresh and that he does not repeat them, he says he keeps updating himself continuously and tries to stay in touch with the times.
Muthukumar says that he is already part of 120 films in 2016. On how he agrees to a project, he says, 'I don't lay too many conditions while accepting a film. I don't insist that I will take up a project only if I like the story. To me, it is more about doing my job well and writing based on what the situation demands.' While he makes certain demands for big-budget films, for small-budget ones, he says he works within their budget.
His rapport with many filmmakers also results in him taking up so many films, he says. 'I have worked with Hari for 12 films, Vijay for nine films and Lingusamy for eight films continuously. Directors know that I meet their expectations and I remain accessible all the time. So, they insist on having me on board as the lyrics writer,' he says.But at the same time, he does draw a line when it comes to the kind of songs that he will write. 'I have my personal code of ethics. I will not write vulgar lines and avoid taking on such songs,' he assures.

This New Year day, actor-director Mahesh Manjrekar is excited about bringing his latest offering, 'Natsamrat' with Nana Patekar in the lead, to the big screens. It is based on VV Shirwadkar aka Kusumagraj's legendary Marathi play of the same name. Coincidentally, it's Nana's birthday today, and what could be a better gift than this role.
Presented by Zee Studios, the production house behind films like 'Katyar Kaljat Ghusli,' 'Killa, Lai Bhaari,' 'Timepass' and 'Fandry,' 'Natsamrat' traces the rise and fall of a passionate theatre artiste.

I've seen the play at least 45 times. Many artistes, including Dr Shriram Lagoo, have lived this part. You get the stamp of a 'good actor' if you can play this character,' Nana laughs.

Antony Blinken also said, “we need to substantially and immediately increase the sustainable humanitarian assistance” into Gaza.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said more needs to be done to “protect Palestinian civilians” in Gaza and that, without that, there will be “no partners for peace.”
Speaking to reporters in Tel Aviv on Friday, Mr. Blinken also said, “we need to substantially and immediately increase the sustainable humanitarian assistance” into Gaza.
He also said it was critical to restore the path toward a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict, calling it the only “guarantor” of a safe and democratic Israel and independent Palestine. He said work on that must begin “not tomorrow, not after today, but today.”

Mr. Blinken urged Israel to do everything in its power to protect civilians caught in the fighting in Gaza and ensure they receive humanitarian aid, while underscoring the country’s right to defend itself. Israel, meanwhile, warned that it was on high alert for attacks on its border with Lebanon as fears grew that the conflict could widen.

Israeli troops tightened their encirclement of Gaza City, the focus of their campaign to crush the enclave’s ruling Hamas militants, who launched a brutal attack on Israeli communities that started the war.

But ever since that Oct. 7 assault, there have been concerns the conflict could ignite fighting on other fronts, and Israel and Lebanon’s Hezbollah militant group have repeatedly traded fire along the border. Tensions escalated further ahead of a speech planned for later Friday by Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah.

Hezbollah, an Iran-backed ally of Hamas, attacked Israeli military positions in northern Israel with drones, mortar fire and suicide drones on Thursday. The Israeli military said it retaliated with warplanes and helicopter gunships, and spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said civilians were wounded in the Hezbollah attacks.

“We are in a high state of readiness in the north, in a very high state of alert, to respond to any event today and in coming days,” he said.

Since Israel's war with Hamas began, Hezbollah has taken calculated steps to keep Israel's military busy on the country's border with Lebanon but so far has done nothing to ignite an all-out war.

A war with Hezbollah would be devastating for both Israel and Lebanon. Hezbollah is much stronger than Hamas, with an arsenal of some 150,000 rockets and missiles, some believed to be precision-guided weapons capable of striking deep inside Israel.

Israel has promised to unleash vast destruction in Lebanon if all-out war erupts, accusing Hezbollah of hiding its military installation in the midst of residential areas. The two enemies fought an inconclusive monthlong war in 2006. Renewed fighting could also risk drawing Iran, which backs both Hamas and Hezbollah, into the conflict.

More than 9,200 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza so far, mostly women and minors, and more and than 23,000 people have been wounded, the Gaza Health Ministry said, without providing a breakdown between civilians and fighters.

More than 1,400 people have died on the Israeli side, mainly civilians killed during Hamas’ initial attack, when some 240 people were also taken hostage. Some 5,400 have also been injured.

Twenty-four Israeli soldiers have been killed in Gaza since the start of the ground operation. Since the start of the war, seven Israeli soldiers and a civilian have been killed in different incidents along Israel’s border with Lebanon.

As American officials have before, Blinken pledged unwavering support for Israel and its right to defend itself while on a visit to the country, but he also stressed the importance of protecting civilians amid growing alarm over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.

“We stand strongly for the proposition that Israel has not only the right but the obligation to defend itself, and to make sure that October 7 should never happen again,"" Blinken said. “How Israel does this matters and it is very important that when it comes to the protection of civilians who are caught in the crossfire of Hamas’ making that everything to be done to protect them and to bring assistance to those who so desperately need it.”

This is Blinken's third trip to Israel since the war began and he also plans to visit Amman, Jordan. It follows President Joe Biden's suggestion for a humanitarian “pause” in the fighting. The aim would be to let in aid for Palestinians and let out more Palestinians who hold foreign passports and wounded.

Around 800 people left Gaza over the past two days — the first time people departed the besieged territory other than four hostages released by Hamas and another rescued by Israeli forces.

Blinken first held talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu behind closed doors before starting wider discussions with the leader and his War Cabinet and meeting with President Isaac Herzog.

More than 3,700 Palestinian children have been killed in 25 days of fighting, according to the Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza. Bombardment has driven more than half the territory’s 2.3 million people from their homes. Food, water and fuel are running low under Israel’s siege, and overwhelmed hospitals warn they are on the verge of collapse.

Israel has allowed more than 260 trucks carrying food and medicine into Gaza, but aid workers say it’s not nearly enough. Israeli authorities have refused to allow fuel in, saying Hamas is hoarding fuel for military use and would steal new supplies.

White House national security spokesman John Kirby said the U.S. was not advocating for a general cease-fire but a “temporary, localized” pause.

Israel has not openly responded to Biden’s suggestion. But Netanyahu, who has previously ruled out a cease-fire, said Thursday: “We are advancing. … Nothing will stop us.” He vowed to destroy Hamas rule in the Gaza Strip.

Israel and the U.S. seem to have no clear plan for what would come next if Hamas rule in Gaza is brought down — a key question on Blinken’s agenda during the visit, according to the State Department.

Meanwhile, military officials said Israeli forces have now completely encircled Gaza City, a densely packed cluster of neighborhoods that Israel says is the center of Hamas military infrastructure and includes a vast network of underground tunnels, bunkers and command centers.

Israeli forces are “fighting in a built-up, dense, complex area,"" said the military’s chief of staff, Herzi Halevy.

Hagari, the military spokesperson, said Israeli forces were in “face to face” battles with militants, calling in airstrikes and shelling when needed. He said they were inflicting heavy losses on Hamas fighters and destroying their infrastructure with engineering equipment.

Hamas’ military wing said early Friday that its fighters battled Israeli troops in several areas in Gaza and claimed they killed four soldiers on the northern edge of the city of Beit Lahiya. It also claimed to have destroyed several tanks with locally made anti-tank rockets.

Neither the reports from Israel nor Hamas could be independently verified.

Casualties on both sides were expected to rise as Israeli troops advance toward the dense residential neighborhoods of Gaza City. Israel has warned residents to immediately evacuate the Shati refugee camp, which borders Gaza City’s center.

But hundreds of thousands of Palestinians remain in the path of fighting in northern Gaza, despite Israel’s repeated calls for them to flee. Many have crowded into U.N. facilities, hoping for safety.

Still, four U.N. schools-turned-shelter in northern Gaza and Bureij were hit in recent days, killing 24 people, according to Philippe Lazzarini, general-secretary of the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA.

In the occupied West Bank overnight, Israeli forces killed seven Palestinians in different places and arrested many more, according to the Israeli military and Palestinian health officials.

Pakistan's general elections will be held on February 8, it was announced on Thursday after the election commission officials met President Arif Alvi at the directives of the Supreme Court, ending uncertainty over the much-awaited polls in the cash-strapped country.

The new date was announced by the President House in a statement following a meeting between the top election officials and President Alvi, hours after the election commission lawyer told the apex court that elections would be held on February 11.


On the order of the Supreme Court, Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja along with Attorney General Mansoor Usman Awan and four members of the electoral body met President Alvi to discuss the general elections date, the president's office said.

""The President heard about the progress the ECP has made in delimitation and for elections. After a detailed discussion the meeting unanimously agreed to hold General Elections in the country on 8th February 2024,  it added.

Earlier, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) told the Supreme Court about the February 11 date during a hearing of a set of petitions calling for holding elections within 90 days after the dissolution of the National Assembly and the provincial legislatures.


Last month, the ECP announced that elections would be held in January 2024 but stopped short of announcing a date.

A three-judge bench comprising Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa, Justice Amin-ud-Din Khan and Justice Athar Minallah took up the pleas moved by the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA), Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf and others.

The ECP had announced earlier that 54 days were needed to hold elections after the completion of the delimitation exercise by November 30, and the apex court bench asked the lawyer of the election body to clearly state the stance on the holding of elections in the country.

In response, Sajeel Swati said that the final list of constituencies will be published on December 5 and all other arrangements including the drawing of constituencies will be completed by January 29. ""Hence we decided that elections will be held on Feb 11, which is the second Sunday,"" the lawyer said.


Later, the chief justice in his order stated that the election date given would have to be implemented. ""SC wants polls to be held without any arguments,  the top judge said.

The ECP announcement coincides with the review talks between Pakistan and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for the release of USD 710 million second tranche of a USD 3 billion loan to the cash-strapped country to stabilise its debt-ridden economy.

The clarity on the election date will strengthen the hands of the Ministry of Finance during the negotiations which started on Thursday, although the IMF has not explicitly attached any such condition.

The issue of the election date had been dragging on for weeks after the dissolution of the National Assembly on August 9, as polls should be held within 90 days but the ECP delayed it in order to finalise the electoral districts following the new census held earlier this year.


President Alvi had written a letter to Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja on September 13 in which he proposed that elections be held by November 6.

However, the Ministry of Law and Justice later informed Alvi that the powers to announce the poll date rested with the ECP, not the president.

During the hearing, Justice Minallah asked why it took the president so long to write the letter to the ECP. On the other hand, the chief justice noted that the text of the said letter was vague.

The CJP said that holding elections was good and not a problem.
The ECP's lawyer, while sharing the schedule with the apex court, said that all arrangements including delimitation will be completed by January 29.


Explaining the delimitation process, the lawyer said it would take them 3 to 5 days to issue the final lists. He added that if 54 days are counted from December 5 then we get the January 29 date.

The lawyer said that the ECP was looking to hold the polls on Sunday to make it easier for the people to participate in the elections. He added that under this plan the first Sunday would have fallen on February 4 and the second would be on February 11.

On hearing this, CJP Isa directed the lawyer to ask the chief election commissioner to consult the president and get back to the court.
The decision has garnered mixed reactions from political parties. The JUI-F has opposed the timing of polls due to weather conditions, while the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) party threw weight behind the ECP.


The PPP and PTI, on the other hand, have called for the immediate announcement of the election date and assurance of a level playing field.

The election date is expected to end the uncertainty in the country as political parties will now move into election mode.","U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has emphasized the need to ""protect Palestinian civilians"" in Gaza and called for an immediate increase in sustainable humanitarian assistance to the region. He stressed the importance of restoring the path to a two-state solution for the Israel-Palestine conflict, describing it as the only way to ensure a safe and democratic Israel alongside an independent Palestine. Blinken urged Israel to do everything possible to protect civilians and ensure they receive humanitarian aid while also affirming Israel's right to self-defense. Amid concerns of the conflict widening, Israel remains on high alert for attacks on its border with Lebanon, particularly from Hezbollah, an Iran-backed ally of Hamas. The situation in Gaza remains dire, with thousands of casualties and a growing humanitarian crisis.

Last month, a 21-year-old student, identified as Anil Kumar, died by suicide inside his hostel room at IIT-Delhi. Preliminary investigations into the case revealed the student was pursuing a B.Tech in Mathematics and Computing. He was placed on an extension due to some incomplete subjects and had been staying at the hostel for the past six months.

Though the police did not recover any suicide notes in the student's room, the reason for taking such an extreme step was suspected to be academic stress.

Indian athletes did very well at the recently concluded Asian Games held in Hangzhou, China, and their feat of garnering over 100 medals for the first time in Asia’s premier track and field competition has been justly celebrated across the country.ndian athletes did very well at the recently concluded Asian Games held in Hangzhou, China, and their feat of garnering over 100 medals for the first time in Asia’s premier track and field competition has been justly celebrated across the country.

Indeed, India’s tally of 107 medals 28 gold, 38 silver and 41 bronze was its best ever Asian Games performance. But the country’s aspiration to become a top sporting nation, at least in Asia, is still some way off; there are miles to go for that to come to fruition. Taking the 1982 Asiad hosted in New Delhi as the baseline, for example, tells us that as a proportion of the total medals competed for, the Indian haul in 2023 107 out of 1500 was inferior to our 1982 performance when we won 57 out of a total 679 medals at stake.

Further, the gap between the leading Asian sporting nation, China, and India, is widening.
In 1982, China won 153 medals to India’s 57 (2.7 times more), and in 2023 the PRC won 383 medals to India’s 107 (3.6 times more). The point being made is that as we celebrate the impressive medals tally in the latest iteration of the Asian Games, it is also a moment for some introspection. India’s massive youth population which is projected to reach 365 million by 2030 needs to start training now if we want to make even a small impression on the world and Olympic stage.Way back in 2007, there was an attempt to introduce a sports policy which never materialised. The implementation of the National Sports Development Code (2011), while a good initiative, has been patchily and the results have therefore been suboptimal though it helped societal internalisation of the fact that sports apart from cricket are not merely pastime but can be a means to drive social development, foster inclusion, and create well paid jobs. The current dispensation has, in this context, shown its commitment to putting money where its mouth is the current fiscal year has the highest ever budget for sports in India’s history and the Centre’s Khelo India and ‘TOPS’ (Target Olympic Podium Scheme) programmes have had a role to play in India’s performance at Hangzhou.

Khelo India has made a difference at the grass-roots with 1,000 budding athletes joining it annually. They receive Rs 6.28 lakh each year to cover expenses from training to pocket money. Many of them move up to the advanced training programme as part of the TOPS developmental group. TOPS also supports elite athletes (core group) with funds, gear, exposure to global sporting competitions, the best coaching, and a monthly allowance of Rs 50,000. Athletes in the developmental group get Rs 25,000 per month.

At Hangzhou, 125 Khelo India athletes participated and 36 of them won medals. Now, the welcome integration of sports into the National Education Policy 2020 must be followed by an emphasis on sports in the National Curriculum Framework for School Education 2023 if India wants to truly change the way citizens at large perceive sports.

NEW DELHI: 'Bharat' seems to be on the fast-track. A railway ministry proposal to the Union Cabinet, the government's highest decision making body, dropped ""India"" replacing it with ""Bharat""- the nomenclature for the country favoured by the Modi administration - in its entire content.
This is perhaps the first proposal for the Cabinet that has used 'Bharat' in place of India in every aspect whether the logistics cost, modal share of cargo and country's economy.
Sources said the usage of 'Bharat' is going to be more in government documents in the coming days. They added that 'India' and 'Bharat' have been used interchangeably in the Constitution and there is nothing wrong in using this inCabinet proposals.
The issue of using ""Bharat"" in place of India garnered attention after an invitation for a G20 dinner sent out by President Droupadi Murmu in her capacity as ""President of Bharat"" instead of ""President of India"". Even at the G20 Leaders' Summit, the country's name was displayed as ""Bharat"" on the name card in front of PM Narendra Modi when he addressed the meeting.
In recent weeks, official releases have been increasingly using 'Bharat' in place of 'India'.

MUMBAI: A four-year-old video shared by BJP on social media of deputy chief minister Devendra Fadnavis saying he will return to helm the state has rocked the political and bureaucratic circles.

""I will return for building a new Maharashtra,"" the state BJP posted on Friday on X, along with the video. The post was deleted a few hours later after BJP leadership took objection over the content on the grounds that such a post would create instability in the three-party Mahayuti government, which is already on a shaky wicket owing to intra-alliance disputes.

The video has been posted at a juncture when state assembly speaker Rahul Narwekar is hearing a petition by Shiv Sena (UBT) MLA Sunil Prabhu against CM Eknath Shinde and a section of Shiv Sena legislators.
Defending the content of the Fadnavis video, state BJP spokesperson Keshav Upadhye said it is part of the Mahajanadesh Yatra and in the past too, it has been circulated on umpteen occasions. The video gives new energy to the younger generation of the party, he added.

Addressing an election rally in the Bhanupratappur assembly constituency in Kanker district, Gandhi asked if Prime Minister Narendra Modi brings up 'OBC' (other backward class) in his speeches, then why he is scared of a caste census.
Caste census will be conducted in the country if the Congress is voted to power, he said.
Bhanupratappur is among the 20 constituencies that will see polling on November 7 in the first phase of the Chhattisgarh elections. The second phase will be held on November 17.
""We are going to take a major step for you which we call 'KG to PG'. From KG (kindergarten) to PG (post-graduation), free education will be provided in government institutions to students (if Congress retains power in state). They will not have to pay a single penny,"" Gandhi said.

Gandhi promised that if the Congress forms the government in the state after polls, then tendu leaves collectors will be given Rs 4,000 per year under the Rajiv Gandhi Protsahan Yojana. This is being seen as a major announcement from the Bhanupratappur seat, which is a part of the tribal-dominated Bastar region.
Pitching for a caste census, he said, ""Narendra Modi ji uses 'OBC' word in his every speech but why he is scared of the caste census...OBCs have to become aware as they are being ditched.""

Gandhi also announced that the Congress would conduct a caste census in the country if it is voted to power in Delhi (at the Centre). ""We have already made this promise for Chhattisgarh,"" he said.


The Congress MP targeted the BJP-led Centre and claimed that it works for the benefit of two-three industrialists. The Congress works in the interest of farmers, Dalits, labourers and Adivasis, he said.

Key promises made by the Congress ahead of the last assembly polls have been fulfilled in Chhattisgarh, he claimed.


Objecting to the use of 'vanvasi' in place of 'Adivasi' for tribals, he said its use by the BJP is an insult to Adivasis and an attack on their culture, history and language.


During his speech, Gandhi stopped briefly and walked to the other corner of the stage carrying a bottle of water apparently after someone fainted on the ground. Gandhi returned to the dais and asked if the person was alright.

BHOPAL: A Madhya Pradesh Congress delegation has submitted a complaint letter to the state election commission against Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and Prime Minister Narendra Modi for delivering a political speech at a government program in Chitrakoot.
Chairman of state Congress unit media department, KK Mishra has alleged that CM Chouhan is a candidate from Budhni assembly constituency in Sehore district for the forthcoming state assembly polls and gave a political speech at a government program in Chitrakoot.
""CM Chouhan is a candidate from Budhni for upcoming state assembly elections and despite being a candidate, he participated in the government program in Chitrakoot. Chouhan also gave a political speech in the program and it was a violation of the model code of conduct,"" Mishra said.
He further said that a case should be registered against PM Modi and CM Chouhan for violating the model code of conduct.


Meanwhile, the congress leader further said, ""The second issue is that the staff officers who are out of their constituency due to election duty should be given ballot papers which are not being given as of now. They should not be deprived of voting rights.""

Mishra also said they had full faith that the State Election Commission would investigate both the cases impartially and would take appropriate action.


Madhya Pradesh is one of the five states set to hold elections this year. The state is scheduled to undergo polls on November 17 and the counting of votes will take place on December 3. Voters will choose legislators from 230 Assembly constituencies.","The Maharashtra BJP stirred controversy by sharing a four-year-old video of Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis stating his intention to return to lead the state for building a ""new Maharashtra."" The post, initially on social media, was later deleted after objections from BJP leadership concerned about potential instability in the already fragile three-party Mahayuti government. The video resurfaced amid ongoing tensions within the alliance, with a petition against CM Eknath Shinde and some Shiv Sena legislators. State BJP spokesperson Keshav Upadhye defended the video, attributing it to the Mahajanadesh Yatra, suggesting it energizes the party's younger generation. The incident underscores the intricacies of alliance politics and the potential impact of historical statements on current political landscapes.","BJP MP Nishikant Dubey took a jibe at Deputy Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis for misspelling his name as 'Dubai' in a letter to Ethics Committee chairman Vinod Sonkar and called her ""Dubai didi"". Dubey's letter to Sonkar, along with the video, sparked controversy in the political and bureaucratic circles. The video was deleted a few hours later after BJP leadership took objection over the content on the grounds that such a post would create instability in the three-party Mahayuti government, which is already on a shaky wicket owing to intra-alliance disputes","A railway ministry proposal to the Union Cabinet, the government's highest decision making body, dropped ""India"" replacing it with ""Bharat""- the nomenclature for the country favoured by the Modi administration - in its entire content. This is perhaps the first proposal for the Cabinet that has used 'Bharat' in place of India in every aspect whether the logistics cost, modal share of cargo and country's economy. Sources said the usage of 'Bharat' is going to be more in government documents in the coming days. They added that 'India' and 'Bharat' have been used interchangeably in the Constitution and there","Congress MP Nishikant Dubey on Friday took a jibe at TMC MP Mahua Moitra for misspelling her name as 'Dubai' in a letter to Ethics Committee chairman Vinod Sonkar and called her 'Dubai didi' in a letter to the Ethics Committee chairman seeking to cross-question Darshan Hiranandani, who has been at the centre of the 'cash for questions' allegation and has turned approver in the case. The Congress MP targeted the BJP-led Centre and claimed that it works for the benefit of farmers, Dalits, labourers and Adivasis."

Gene therapy is a cutting-edge medical field that holds the promise of treating genetic disorders by altering the very building blocks of life: DNA. In this explainer, we'll delve into the fascinating world of gene therapy, uncovering how it works and the potential it holds for transforming medicine.
Understanding Gene Therapy

At its core, gene therapy is a medical approach that involves modifying or manipulating a person's genes to treat or prevent disease. It's a groundbreaking departure from traditional treatments that often focus on managing symptoms rather than addressing the root cause.

The Role of DNA
DNA, the famous double helix, is the genetic blueprint that contains the instructions for building and operating every part of your body. In gene therapy, scientists and medical professionals target specific genes within your DNA to correct or replace faulty genetic instructions.

Types of Gene Therapy
Gene therapy comes in various forms, but two primary approaches dominate the field:

Somatic Gene Therapy: This approach targets non-reproductive cells in the body (most cells). It aims to treat diseases in the individual patient and is not passed on to future generations.
Germline Gene Therapy: This technique focuses on altering genes in reproductive cells (sperm or egg cells) and is intended to be inherited by offspring. It's a much more complex and controversial area due to ethical and safety concerns.
The Process of Gene Therapy

Gene therapy typically follows these general steps:
Identification: Scientists identify the specific gene responsible for a genetic disorder.
Correction: Using various methods, they introduce a healthy copy of the gene or repair the faulty one.
Delivery: The corrected gene is delivered into the patient's body, often using modified viruses as carriers or other delivery methods.
Integration: The corrected gene integrates into the patient's DNA and starts producing the missing or functioning protein.
Monitoring: Continuous monitoring helps assess the therapy's effectiveness and safety.
Applications of Gene Therapy

Gene therapy has shown promise in treating a wide range of genetic disorders, including:

Cystic Fibrosis
Hemophilia
Muscular Dystrophy
Sickle Cell Anemia
Certain Types of Cancer
Blindness caused by genetic mutations

Challenges and Ethical Considerations

While gene therapy offers immense potential, it also raises significant challenges. These include concerns about safety, off-target effects, and the long-term consequences of genetic modifications. Ethical questions about germline gene editing, accessibility, and affordability are also hotly debated.

The Future of Gene Therapy

As technology advances and our understanding of genetics deepens, the future of gene therapy holds promise for even more transformative treatments. It's an exciting frontier where science fiction becomes science fact, offering hope to patients and their families affected by genetic disorders.


Conclusion: A Revolution in Medicine

Gene therapy represents a remarkable advancement in medical science, where the manipulation of DNA can potentially cure diseases once thought incurable. While challenges and ethical considerations remain, the potential to improve lives and change the course of medicine is undeniable.

Gene therapy exemplifies the power of human innovation and determination to conquer the most complex challenges in the pursuit of a healthier, disease-free future.

Israel-Hamas War News: Israel pounds Gaza, evacuates town near Lebanon ahead of expected ground offensive against Hamas

Israel bombarded Gaza early Friday, hitting areas in the south where Palestinians had been told to seek safety, and it began evacuating a sizable Israeli town in the north near the Lebanese border, the latest sign of a potential ground invasion of Gaza that could trigger regional turmoil. On Thursday, Israel's Defense Minister Yoav Gallant ordered ground troops to prepare to see Gaza “from the inside,” hinting at a ground offensive aimed at crushing Gaza's militant Hamas rulers nearly two weeks after their bloody incursion into Israel. Officials have given no timetable for such an operation.

RBI Monetary Policy Statements
RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das further said:

Even as headline inflation experienced considerable volatility, a silver lining has been the declining core inflation, supported by declining cost push pressures and ongoing transmission of past monetary policy actions.
To sum up, domestic economic growth is maintaining the momentum. Our fundamental goal is to align inflation with the 4.0 per cent target and anchor inflation expectations. Recurring incidences of large and overlapping supply side shocks bring with them the risks of generalisation of inflation impulses, possible loss of monetary policy credibility and de-anchoring of inflation expectations.

The moderation in inflation in September would also be aided by the sharp reduction in household LPG prices in end-August. The projections suggest that throughout much of Q3:2023-24, food inflation pressures may not see a sustained easing, but ample buffer stocks of food grains, softening edible oil prices, and government’s proactive supply side interventions are expected to keep check on unusual price spikes of key food items, RBI governor Das said.

India is poised to become the new growth engine of the world backed by its strong domestic macroeconomic fundamentals and buffers. The judicious policy mix pursued during the recent years to deal with multiple and unparalleled shocks has fostered economic stability.

The spike in vegetable prices has likely corrected substantially in September and inflation is expected to fall significantly below the upper tolerance level of 6 per cent.

In a brutal terror attack, Hamas killed 1400, kidnapped 203, and injured 3800 innocent Israeli people. Israel has responded by declaring war on Hamas.

There have been varied opinions from global leaders to the determined stand taken by the Israeli government and the unleashing of its brute force to put an end to the terrorism of Hamas on its people. Pope Francis told the gathering at St Peter’s Square on Wednesday, “The victims are increasing and the situation in Gaza is desperate. May, please everything, everything be done to avoid a humanitarian disaster, and it’s possible that this war might grow. War does not solve any problems. It only sows death and destruction. It increases hatred and multiplies revenge. War destroys the future.”

Pope Francis has called for an end to Israel-Palestinian violence and has made public his views on war not being able to solve any problems only sowing seeds of death, hatred, revenge, and destruction. But, interestingly, the Catholic Church has been a strong advocate of a ‘Just War’.

In the words of St Augustine of Hippo – a bishop, philosopher, and theologian of the Catholic Church: The only just reason to go to war was the desire for peace. We do not seek peace in order to be at war, but we go to war so that we may have peace. Be peaceful, therefore, in warring, so that you may vanquish those whom you war against, and bring them to the prosperity of peace.

Furthermore in his book – City of God, St Augustine expressed, “A state has higher authority in their view, and if the response to evil and aggression met specific criteria, it would be deemed just, and the individual could participate. True religion looks upon as peaceful those wars that are waged not for motives of aggrandizement, or cruelty, but with the object of securing peace, punishing those who do evil, and of supporting the good.”

The ‘Just War’ theory of the Catholic Church attempts to reconcile three things: One, taking human life is seriously wrong. Two, states have a duty to defend their citizens and defend justice. And three, protecting innocent human life and defending important moral values sometimes requires the willingness to use force and violence. The principles of the justice of war are commonly held to be: having just cause, being a last resort, being declared by a proper authority, possessing the right intention, having a reasonable chance of success, and the end being proportional to the means used.

The Catholic Church recognizes that a nation has not just the right, but the obligation to ensure the security of its citizens and to respond to aggression, even – if only under very strict conditions – by means of military force.

In July 2022, Pope Francis during a 90-minute interview with Telam, the news agency of the Argentine state, answered a question about lack of dialogue being an aggravating factor for a world that he believes is currently living a piecemeal Third World War stated: I believe it is time to rethink the concept of a ‘just war’. A war may be just; there is the right to defend oneself. But we need to rethink the way that concept is used nowadays. I have said that the use and possession of nuclear weapons are immoral. Resolving conflicts through war is saying no to verbal reasoning, to being constructive. But interestingly in March 2022, Pope Francis opined that there is no such thing as a just war; when he spoke about the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia.

Israel is not attacking Palestine. Israel is at war with Hamas. Hamas is a terror organization. A war against a terror organization, however, is not the same as a war about territory. It is a new kind of war. It is a war against an enemy who does not represent a nation or a people in the traditional sense but represents an ideology of terror.

A war against terrorism is a war to re-establish, in a world torn by fear and strife, respect for the dignity of persons and their rights; it is a war that wants not simply to block an enemy, but to foster an equitable coexistence and order in the relationships between persons, peoples, and cultures. That is exactly what Israel wants for its people. In a war against terror, winning the war means winning the peace. And peace can only be restored when terrorism is put to an end. Therefore, the only end game for Israel is to end the terror, and to end the terror is to end Hamas. For Palestinians too, the end of Hamas will sound the bugle of a new dawn of peace between Israel and Palestine in the months ahead.

Political leaders questioning the principles of Israel’s actions against Hamas must first understand that Israel is not fighting Palestine and it is not in a war against a nation, neither does it seek to occupy Gaza. Israel is fighting a war against terror and Hamas is the terrorist. Israel is protecting the basic human rights of its citizens, rights that Hamas violated on October 7th, 2023. Nations, including the Arab Nations must willingly or grudgingly accept the simple truth that Israel has waged a ‘Just War’ against Hamas.

CHANGLANG, 24 Oct: In a shocking development, the presence – or rather, the absence – of ghost staffers has surfaced in the education department in Changlang district.

The development comes in the wake of rampant illegal appointments made in the department across the state.

Changlang DC Sunny K Singh issued an order on 20 October, stating that “some ghost staffers have been detected in the education department who are drawing salaries without physical presence.”


Stating that there is a possibility of similar ghost staffers’ ‘presence’ in other departments also, Singh further directed all heads of departments in the district to “verify the status and submit a certificate that all employees of their respective departments exist on the ground.”

The DC had on 19 October issued a notice to the Changlang DDSE, directing the latter to “verify all the regular staffers, including teaching and non-teaching staffers such as LDC, UDC, MTS, etc, through BRCCs and CRCCs, in order to rule out the existence of any ghost staffer enrolled with the education department.”

“It has been brought to the notice of the administration that there appear few regular staffers of the education department whose presence in the district is difficult to establish, yet their salary is drawn every month,” the DC stated.

He further pointed out that “there is a possibility of ghost staffers drawing salaries without their presence, and their antecedents only exist on paper, which, if established to be correct, will be deemed illegal and unlawful.”

It is learnt that the DDSE is yet to respond to the DC’s directive to submit the report.

It is alleged that five staffers under the DDSE have questionable appointment orders. However, their salaries were processed till September this year from Itanagar.

Among the five staffers, it is alleged that one was attached with Deputy Speaker and Changlang MLA Tesam Pongte’s private residence, and another staffer was attached with the DDSE.


Unverified sources claimed that the salaries of the ghost staffers were held back recently, after a minor shuffling among the staffers in the directorate office. The sources further said that the matter came to light after a few questionable staffers started approaching various authorities, seeking remedy and reinstatement of their salaries.

It is reported also that an LDC and a UDC, who never joined duty in Changlang, were allegedly drawing their salaries.

“Their presence in the district could not be established. The salaries of the employees are made based on attendance registers; so there emerges a valid question that, if they were not present, how come their attendance was marked and thus salaries processed month after month?” asked an angry youth on condition of anonymity.

“The disclosure of this new episode has brought to the fore many unanswered questions for the education department to clarify,” he said.

 It is alleged that the ghost staffers were appointed during the then DDSE Ego Doye’s tenure. However, when this daily contacted him, Doye denied the allegation and said that the appointments were made by the directorate and not by him.

When contacted, Education Commissioner Amjad Tak said that the education department is committed to unearth the truth. “If the allegations are true, appropriate action will be immediately initiated, whoever is involved in the scam,” Tak said.

It posted revenue from operations at Rs 1,368.63 crore, up 5.2% as against Rs 1,301.49 crore during the corresponding quarter of last year.stock price fell 4% in the last five days and 7.44% in the last one month, while it gained 13.71% in the last six months and marginally 0.05% year to date We are downgrading Jubilant FoodWorks (JFL) to ‘Hold’ as the recent run-up does not dovetail with its performance. In fact, we are adjusting down FY24E/25E EBITDA by 5%/5%, factoring in the performance despite building in a robust LFL showing in Q3FY24 (7%). Longer term, JFL is targeting LFL of 5–6%. We ascribe the stock a PE of 50x, similar to its five-year pre-covid average (FY15–19 average SSSG/revenue CAGR of 6%/15% versus FY24–26E’s 4%/11%), and value Popeyes’ separately. This yields a Target Price of Rs 541 (Rs 549 earlier).”Macro, as well as the base, is yet to turn favourable for Jubilant Foodworks, evident from another miss in 2Q. SSG declined an est. 5%; dine-in faced severe pressure while delivery grew at overall level. Management continues to take self-help measures (new org structure, tech investments, store re-imaging, 20-min delivery etc.) and hopes for a 2H recovery. Even while Jubilant Foodworks is a structural play, we stay on sideline given uncertainty on SSG recovery & therefore, earnings. ‘Hold’.”Jubilant Foodworks in its rejuvenated approach to drive growth through portfolio expansion in Domino’s and chicken QSR segment (Popeyes), coupled with enhanced consumer experience in value segment and by reimaging store could achieve mid-single digit LFL growth. Though weak demand, incremental competition in pizza QSR, and rising inflation pose short-term challenges, we expect JUBI to defend its current margin. We cut FY24E/ FY25E earning by 6.5%/3.0% and introduce FY26E estimates and retain ‘Buy’ with a revised DCF-based Target Price of Rs 625 (implying EV/EBITDA of 20.0x avg. FY25E/FY26E). Key risks to our call prolonged weakness in demand, rising inflation in key RM/PM & severe competition in chicken portfolio from peers.”

Axis Bank’s share price surged 1.52% to Rs 970, a day after the Bank posted a 10% growth in net profit at Rs 5,863 crore for the second quarter of FY24 as compared to Rs 5,329 crore in Q2FY23. The total income of the Bank in the second quarter of FY24 surged to Rs 31,660 crore compared to Rs 24, 094 crore in q2FY23.  Axis Bank’s stock price fell 1.97% in the last five days and 4.55% in the last one month, while it has gained 9.11% in the last six months and 5.82% in the last one year.We tweak estimates and see 16% Cagr in profits (normalised) over FY23-26. The bank has also accreted capital of 54bps during 1H to 15% CET-1 CAR. We feel the bank can also anchor the 18% ROE quite well, that should allow for decent compounding. At 1.5x FY25 adj. PB and 9x adj. PE, valuations are attractive and around 25% discount to ICICI Bank. Axis is among our top picks in the sector with Target Price of Rs 1,250 (Rs 1,200 earlier) based on 1.9x Sep-25 adjusted PB. ‘Buy’ call stays.”

We remain watchful of deposit accretion for the bank as it will be critical to sustain healthy loan growth (targets 400-600bp higher growth vs. system over the medium term). Asset quality remains robust, with slippages declining further and recoveries remaining strong. We change our earnings estimates by -1.7%/2.1% for FY24/FY25 and expect FY25 RoA/RoE of 1.9%/16.6%. We retain our ‘Buy’ rating with a Target Price of Rs 1,150 (1.7x FY25E ABV)“In our view, Axis Bank continues to be in investment mode w.r.t to its distribution and liability franchise as well as digital initiatives. While initial signs of success are visible, we believe it will take some time for the bank in closing the gap with larger private sector peers. In our view, NIMs sustainability coupled with steady loan growth will lead to meaningful valuation upsides for Axis Bank. Given the long-term measures undertaken to improve the liability franchise and portfolio granularity, we expect ROA/ ROE of 1.7%/ 17.6% in FY25E. We maintain ‘Buy’ with a Target Price of Rs 1,040 valuing the core bank at 1.8x FY25E P/BV.”We prefer to remain skeptical of Axis Bank’s growth, margin and asset quality trajectory in the near term. We have valued the standalone bank at 1.8x FY25F BV and added Rs 50/share for subsidiaries. Accordingly, we have arrived at a revised target price of Rs 1,050 (Rs 1,030 earlier) and maintained our ‘Hold’ rating on the stock. Better-than-expected growth/margins pose an upside risk while lower profits are a downside risk.

The DC had on 19 October issued a notice to the Changlang DDSE, directing the latter to “verify all the regular staffers, including teaching and non-teaching staffers such as LDC, UDC, MTS, etc, through BRCCs and CRCCs, in order to rule out the existence of any ghost staffer enrolled with the education department.”

“It has been brought to the notice of the administration that there appear few regular staffers of the education department whose presence in the district is difficult to establish, yet their salary is drawn every month,” the DC stated.

He further pointed out that “there is a possibility of ghost staffers drawing salaries without their presence, and their antecedents only exist on paper, which, if established to be correct, will be deemed illegal and unlawful.”

It is learnt that the DDSE is yet to respond to the DC’s directive to submit the report.

It is alleged that five staffers under the DDSE have questionable appointment orders. However, their salaries were processed till September this year from Itanagar.

Among the five staffers, it is alleged that one was attached with Deputy Speaker and Changlang MLA Tesam Pongte’s private residence, and another staffer was attached with the DDSE.


Unverified sources claimed that the salaries of the ghost staffers were held back recently, after a minor shuffling among the staffers in the directorate office. The sources further said that the matter came to light after a few questionable staffers started approaching various authorities, seeking remedy and reinstatement of their salaries.

It is reported also that an LDC and a UDC, who never joined duty in Changlang, were allegedly drawing their salaries.

“Their presence in the district could not be established. The salaries of the employees are made based on attendance registers; so there emerges a valid question that, if they were not present, how come their attendance was marked and thus salaries processed month after month?” asked an angry youth on condition of anonymity.

“The disclosure of this new episode has brought to the fore many unanswered questions for the education department to clarify,” he said.

 It is alleged that the ghost staffers were appointed during the then DDSE Ego Doye’s tenure. However, when this daily contacted him, Doye denied the allegation and said that the appointments were made by the directorate and not by him.

When contacted, Education Commissioner Amjad Tak said that the education department is committed to unearth the truth. “If the allegations are true, appropriate action will be immediately initiated, whoever is involved in the scam,” Tak said.

The Tripura government has signed an agreement with Asian Development Bank (ADB) amounting to Rs 2,275 crore to strengthen and improve power distribution efficiency in the northeastern state, Deputy Chief Minister Jishnu Dev Varma said on Saturday.
Terming the agreement as “historic” for the state, Dev Varma said it is the single biggest project in any plan through an externally aided project. “The project agreement was signed by Power Secretary, Govt of Tripura, Brijesh Pandey and Nilaya Mitesh, the officer in charge of ADB’s Indian Resident Mission, New Delhi, remotely on Friday after extensive deliberation and evolution”, Dev Varma said at a press conference here.
The deputy chief minister said the ADB project will support the state government’s efforts to strengthen its power sector by replacing inefficient power plants and strengthening the distribution system. Of the Rs 2,275 crore fund, the central government will repay Rs 1,820 crore while the state is supposed to provide Rs 455 crore, he said, adding the project will be implemented in the next three years.
Heaping praise on Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman for clearing the first externally aided project for the power sector in the state, Dev Varma said the state government will undertake massive renovation of two power projects – Rukhia in Sepahijala district and Gumati Hydro project in Gomati district. Besides, there will be a lot of work in the transmission sector to improve the existing system.
At present, gas based Rukhia power project produces 66 MW power and its installed capacity will be doubled by modernizing the plant, he said, adding the Dumbur hydro power project’s capacity will be increased from 5 MW to 10 MW. The externally aided project will benefit five to six lakh consumers and it will also generate 6,000 to 6,500 direct jobs in different levels.
Asserting that Rs 3,000 crore will be invested in the northeastern state’s power sector, the DyCM said the government aims to provide quality power supply to the consumers. However, no new power plant is proposed in the ADB project. (PTI)
Currently, the northeastern state generates 84 MW power out of the state’s per day demand of 450/460 MW. It receives around 500 MW power from OTPC, NEEPCO and other central PSUs. The states export 160 MW power to Bangladesh.
Apart from the ADB funding, an additional amount of Rs 800 crore will be spent to improve the power distribution which includes underground transmission line in Agartala city and installation of smart electric meters.","The District Development Committee (DDC) has issued directives to expedite the restoration of roads that were dug up by the Kerala Water Authority (KWA).
